This can be done using one of the following two methods: Open the Visual Studio project, right click on the project name, and select Build Dependencies &gt; Build Customizations\u2026 , then select the CUDA Toolkit version you would like to target. Alternatively, you can configure your project always to build with the most recently installed version of the CUDA Toolkit. First add a CUDA build customization to your project as above. Then, right click on the project name and select Properties . Under CUDA C/C++ , select Common , and set the CUDA Toolkit Custom Dir field to $(CUDA_PATH) . Note that the $(CUDA_PATH) environment variable is set by the installer. While Option 2 will allow your project to automatically use any new CUDA Toolkit version you may install in the future, selecting the toolkit version explicitly as in Option 1 is often better in practice, because if there are new CUDA configuration options added to the build customization rules accompanying the newer toolkit, you would not see those new options using Option 2. If you use the $(CUDA_PATH) environment variable to target a version of the CUDA Toolkit for building, and you perform an installation or uninstallation of any version of the CUDA Toolkit, you should validate that the $(CUDA_PATH) environment variable points to the correct installation directory of the CUDA Toolkit for your purposes. You can access the value of the $(CUDA_PATH) environment variable via the following steps: Open a run window from the Start Menu. Run: control sysdm.cpl Select the Advanced tab at the top of the window. Click Environment Variables at the bottom of the window. Files which contain CUDA code must be marked as a CUDA C/C++ file. This can done when adding the file by right clicking the project you wish to add the file to, selecting Add New Item , selecting NVIDIA CUDA 12.6\\CodeCUDA C/C++ File , and then selecting the file you wish to add. For advanced users, if you wish to try building your project against a newer CUDA Toolkit without making changes to any of your project files, go to the Visual Studio command prompt, change the current directory to the location of your project, and execute a command such as the following: msbuild &lt;projectname.extension&gt; /t:Rebuild /p:CudaToolkitDir=&quot;drive:/path/to/new/toolkit/&quot;", "keywords": []}, {"id": 4, "doc_id": 26, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#build-customizations-for-new-projects", "display_name": "Build Customizations for New Projects", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "build-customizations-for-new-projects", "priority": -1, "content": "When creating a new CUDA application, the Visual Studio project file must be configured to include CUDA build customizations.

Extracting and Inspecting the Files Manually Sometimes it may be desirable to extract or inspect the installable files directly, such as in enterprise deployment, or to browse the files before installation. The full installation package can be extracted using a decompression tool which supports the LZMA compression method, such as 7-zip or WinZip . Once extracted, the CUDA Toolkit files will be in the CUDAToolkit folder, and similarily for CUDA Visual Studio Integration. Within each directory is a .dll and .nvi file that can be ignored as they are not part of the installable files.

CUDA \u00ae is a parallel computing platform and programming model invented by NVIDIA. It enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of the graphics processing unit (GPU). CUDA was developed with several design goals in mind: Provide a small set of extensions to standard programming languages, like C, that enable a straightforward implementation of parallel algorithms. With CUDA C/C++, programmers can focus on the task of parallelization of the algorithms rather than spending time on their implementation. Support heterogeneous computation where applications use both the CPU and GPU. Serial portions of applications are run on the CPU, and parallel portions are offloaded to the GPU. As such, CUDA can be incrementally applied to existing applications. The CPU and GPU are treated as separate devices that have their own memory spaces. This configuration also allows simultaneous computation on the CPU and GPU without contention for memory resources. CUDA-capable GPUs have hundreds of cores that can collectively run thousands of computing threads. These cores have shared resources including a register file and a shared memory. The on-chip shared memory allows parallel tasks running on these cores to share data without sending it over the system memory bus. This guide will show you how to install and check the correct operation of the CUDA development tools.", "keywords": []}]};
