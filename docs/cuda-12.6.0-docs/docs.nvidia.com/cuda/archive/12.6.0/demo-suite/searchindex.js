In this mode, the position and velocity data for all bodies are read from system memory using \u201czero copy\u201d rather than from device memory. For a small number of devices (4 or fewer) and a large enough number of bodies, bandwidth is not a bottleneck so we can achieve strong scaling across these devices.
