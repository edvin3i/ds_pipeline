See Table 3 . For more information various GPU products that are CUDA capable, visit https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus . Each release of the CUDA Toolkit requires a minimum version of the CUDA driver. The CUDA driver is backward compatible, meaning that applications compiled against a particular version of the CUDA will continue to work on subsequent (later) driver releases.
