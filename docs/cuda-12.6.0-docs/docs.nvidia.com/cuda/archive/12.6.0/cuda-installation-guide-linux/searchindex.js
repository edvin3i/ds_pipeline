Performs an installation with no further user-input and minimal command-line output based on the options provided below. Silent installations are useful for scripting the installation of CUDA. Using this option implies acceptance of the EULA. The following flags can be used to customize the actions taken during installation. At least one of --driver , --uninstall , and --toolkit must be passed if running with non-root permissions. --driver Install the CUDA Driver. --toolkit Install the CUDA Toolkit. --toolkitpath=&lt;path&gt; Install the CUDA Toolkit to the &lt;path&gt; directory. If not provided, the default path of /usr/local/cuda-12.4 is used. --defaultroot=&lt;path&gt; Install libraries to the &lt;path&gt; directory. If the &lt;path&gt; is not provided, then the default path of your distribution is used. This only applies to the libraries installed outside of the CUDA Toolkit path. Extraction --extract=&lt;path&gt; Extracts to the &lt;path&gt; the following: the driver runfile, the raw files of the toolkit to &lt;path&gt;. This is especially useful when one wants to install the driver using one or more of the command-line options provided by the driver installer which are not exposed in this installer. Overriding Installation Checks --override Ignores compiler, third-party library, and toolkit detection checks which would prevent the CUDA Toolkit from installing. No OpenGL Libraries --no-opengl-libs Prevents the driver installation from installing NVIDIA\u2019s GL libraries. Useful for systems where the display is driven by a non-NVIDIA GPU. In such systems, NVIDIA\u2019s GL libraries could prevent X from loading properly. No man pages --no-man-page Do not install the man pages under /usr/share/man . Overriding Kernel Source --kernel-source-path=&lt;path&gt; Tells the driver installation to use &lt;path&gt; as the kernel source directory when building the NVIDIA kernel module. Required for systems where the kernel source is installed to a non-standard location. Running nvidia-xconfig --run-nvidia-xconfig Tells the driver installation to run nvidia-xconfig to update the system X configuration file so that the NVIDIA X driver is used. The pre-existing X configuration file will be backed up. No nvidia-drm kernel module --no-drm Do not install the nvidia-drm kernel module. This option should only be used to work around failures to build or install the nvidia-drm kernel module on systems that do not need the provided features. Custom Temporary Directory Selection --tmpdir=&lt;path&gt; Performs any temporary actions within &lt;path&gt; instead of /tmp . Useful in cases where /tmp cannot be used (doesn\u2019t exist, is full, is mounted with \u2018noexec\u2019, etc.).

Scenario Instructions Install CUDA using the Package Manager installation method without installing the NVIDIA GL libraries. Fedora Install CUDA using the following command: sudo dnf install cuda-toolkit-12-4 \\ nvidia-driver-cuda akmod-nvidia Follow the instructions here to ensure that Nouveau is disabled. If performing an upgrade over a previous installation, the NVIDIA kernel module may need to be rebuilt by following the instructions here . OpenSUSE/SLES On some system configurations the NVIDIA GL libraries may need to be locked before installation using: sudo zypper addlock nvidia-glG04 Install CUDA using the following command: sudo zypper install --no-recommends cuda-toolkit-12-4 \\ nvidia-computeG04 \\ nvidia-gfxG04-kmp-default Follow the instructions here to ensure that Nouveau is disabled. Ubuntu This functionality isn\u2019t supported on Ubuntu. Instead, the driver packages integrate with the Bumblebee framework to provide a solution for users who wish to control what applications the NVIDIA drivers are used for. See Ubuntu\u2019s Bumblebee wiki for more information. Upgrade from a RPM/Deb driver installation which includes the diagnostic driver packages to a driver installation which does not include the diagnostic driver packages. RHEL/CentOS Remove diagnostic packages using the following command: sudo yum remove cuda-drivers-diagnostic \\ xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-diagnostic Follow the instructions here to continue installation as normal. Fedora Remove diagnostic packages using the following command: sudo dnf remove cuda-drivers-diagnostic \\ xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-diagnostic Follow the instructions here to continue installation as normal. OpenSUSE/SLES Remove diagnostic packages using the following command: sudo zypper remove cuda-drivers-diagnostic \\ nvidia-diagnosticG04 Follow the instructions here to continue installation as normal. Ubuntu Remove diagnostic packages using the following command: sudo apt-get purge cuda-drivers-diagnostic \\ nvidia-384-diagnostic Follow the instructions here to continue installation as normal. Use a specific GPU for rendering the display. Add or replace a Device entry in your xorg.conf file, located at /etc/X11/xorg.conf . The Device entry should resemble the following: Section &quot;Device&quot; Identifier &quot;Device0&quot; Driver &quot;driver_name&quot; VendorName &quot;vendor_name&quot; BusID &quot;bus_id&quot; EndSection The details will you will need to add differ on a case-by-case basis. For example, if you have two NVIDIA GPUs and you want the first GPU to be used for display, you would replace \u201c driver_name \u201d with \u201c nvidia \u201d, \u201c vendor_name \u201d with \u201c NVIDIA Corporation \u201d and \u201c bus_id \u201d with the Bus ID of the GPU. The Bus ID will resemble \u201cPCI:00:02.0\u201d and can be found by running lspci . Install CUDA to a specific directory using the Package Manager installation method. RPM The RPM packages don\u2019t support custom install locations through the package managers (Yum and Zypper), but it is possible to install the RPM packages to a custom location using rpm\u2019s --relocate parameter: sudo rpm --install --relocate /usr/local/cuda-12.4=/new/toolkit package.rpm You will need to install the packages in the correct dependency order; this task is normally taken care of by the package managers. For example, if package \u201cfoo\u201d has a dependency on package \u201cbar\u201d, you should install package \u201cbar\u201d first, and package \u201cfoo\u201d second. You can check the dependencies of a RPM package as follows: rpm -qRp package.rpm Note that the driver packages cannot be relocated. Deb The Deb packages do not support custom install locations. It is however possible to extract the contents of the Deb packages and move the files to the desired install location. See the next scenario for more details one xtracting Deb packages. Extract the contents of the installers. Runfile The Runfile can be extracted into the standalone Toolkit and Driver Runfiles by using the --extract parameter. The Toolkit standalone Runfiles can be further extracted by running: ./runfile.run --tar mxvf The Driver Runfile can be extracted by running: ./runfile.run -x RPM The RPM packages can be extracted by running: rpm2cpio package.rpm | cpio -idmv Deb The Deb packages can be extracted by running: dpkg-deb -x package.deb output_dir Modify Ubuntu\u2019s apt package manager to query specific architectures for specific repositories. This is useful when a foreign architecture has been added, causing \u201c404 Not Found\u201d errors to appear when the repository meta-data is updated. Each repository you wish to restrict to specific architectures must have its sources.list entry modified. This is done by modifying the /etc/apt/sources.list file and any files containing repositories you wish to restrict under the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory. Normally, it is sufficient to modify only the entries in /etc/apt/sources.list An architecture-restricted repository entry looks like: deb [arch=&lt;arch1&gt;,&lt;arch2&gt;] &lt;url&gt; For example, if you wanted to restrict a repository to only the amd64 and i386 architectures, it would look like: deb [arch=amd64,i386] &lt;url&gt; It is not necessary to restrict the deb-src repositories, as these repositories don\u2019t provide architecture-specific packages. For more details, see the sources.list manpage. The nvidia.ko kernel module fails to load, saying some symbols are unknown. For example: nvidia: Unknown symbol drm_open (err 0) Check to see if there are any optionally installable modules that might provide these symbols which are not currently installed. For the example of the drm_open symbol, check to see if there are any packages which provide drm_open and are not already installed. For instance, on Ubuntu 14.04, the linux-image-extra package provides the DRM kernel module (which provides drm_open ). This package is optional even though the kernel headers reflect the availability of DRM regardless of whether this package is installed or not. The runfile installer fails to extract due to limited space in the TMP directory. This can occur on systems with limited storage in the TMP directory (usually /tmp ), or on systems which use a tmpfs in memory to handle temporary storage. In this case, the --tmpdir command-line option should be used to instruct the runfile to use a directory with sufficient space to extract into. More information on this option can be found here . Re-enable Wayland after installing the RPM driver on Fedora. Wayland is disabled during installation of the Fedora driver RPM due to compatability issues. To re-enable Wayland, comment out this line in /etc/gdm/custom.conf : WaylandEnable=false In case of the error: E: Failed to fetch file:/var/cuda-repo File not found Debian and Ubuntu This can occur when installing CUDA after uninstalling a different version.

Run the installer and follow the on-screen prompts: sudo sh cuda_&lt;version&gt;_linux.run The installer will prompt for the following: EULA Acceptance CUDA Driver installation CUDA Toolkit installation, location, and /usr/local/cuda symbolic link The default installation location for the toolkit is /usr/local/cuda-12.4 : The /usr/local/cuda symbolic link points to the location where the CUDA Toolkit was installed. This link allows projects to use the latest CUDA Toolkit without any configuration file update. The installer must be executed with sufficient privileges to perform some actions. When the current privileges are insufficient to perform an action, the installer will ask for the user\u2019s password to attempt to install with root privileges. Actions that cause the installer to attempt to install with root privileges are: installing the CUDA Driver installing the CUDA Toolkit to a location the user does not have permission to write to creating the /usr/local/cuda symbolic link Running the installer with sudo , as shown above, will give permission to install to directories that require root permissions. Directories and files created while running the installer with sudo will have root ownership. If installing the driver, the installer will also ask if the openGL libraries should be installed. If the GPU used for display is not an NVIDIA GPU, the NVIDIA openGL libraries should not be installed. Otherwise, the openGL libraries used by the graphics driver of the non-NVIDIA GPU will be overwritten and the GUI will not work. If performing a silent installation, the --no-opengl-libs option should be used to prevent the openGL libraries from being installed. See the Advanced Options section for more details. If the GPU used for display is an NVIDIA GPU, the X server configuration file, /etc/X11/xorg.conf , may need to be modified. In some cases, nvidia-xconfig can be used to automatically generate an xorg.conf file that works for the system. For non-standard systems, such as those with more than one GPU, it is recommended to manually edit the xorg.conf file. Consult the xorg.conf documentation for more information. Installing Mesa may overwrite the /usr/lib/libGL.so that was previously installed by the NVIDIA driver, so a reinstallation of the NVIDIA driver might be required after installing these libraries. Reboot the system to reload the graphical interface: sudo reboot Verify the device nodes are created properly.

CUDA \u00ae is a parallel computing platform and programming model invented by NVIDIA \u00ae . It enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of the graphics processing unit (GPU). CUDA was developed with several design goals in mind: Provide a small set of extensions to standard programming languages, like C, that enable a straightforward implementation of parallel algorithms. With CUDA C/C\ufeff+\ufeff+, programmers can focus on the task of parallelization of the algorithms rather than spending time on their implementation. Support heterogeneous computation where applications use both the CPU and GPU. Serial portions of applications are run on the CPU, and parallel portions are offloaded to the GPU. As such, CUDA can be incrementally applied to existing applications. The CPU and GPU are treated as separate devices that have their own memory spaces. This configuration also allows simultaneous computation on the CPU and GPU without contention for memory resources. CUDA-capable GPUs have hundreds of cores that can collectively run thousands of computing threads. These cores have shared resources including a register file and a shared memory. The on-chip shared memory allows parallel tasks running on these cores to share data without sending it over the system memory bus. This guide will show you how to install and check the correct operation of the CUDA development tools.", "keywords": []}]};
