Applications that have multiple source translation units have to be compiled in separate compilation mode. LTO (introduced in CUDA 11.4) allowed nvlink to perform optimizations at device link time instead of at compile time so that separately compiled applications with several translation units can be optimized to the same level as whole program compilations with a single translation unit. However, without the option to output PTX, applications that cared about forward compatibility of device code could not benefit from Link Time Optimization or had to constrain the device code to a single source file. With the option for nvlink that performs LTO to generate the output in PTX, customer applications that require forward compatibility across GPU architectures can span across multiple files and can also take advantage of Link Time Optimization.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 3, "doc_id": 11, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#int128-developer-tool-support", "display_name": "INT128 developer tool support", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "int128-developer-tool-support", "priority": -1, "content": "In 11.5, CUDA C++ support for 128 bit was added.
