Both cubin and PTX are generated for a certain target compute capability. A cubin generated for a certain compute capability is supported to run on any GPU with the same major revision and same or higher minor revision of compute capability. For example, a cubin generated for compute capability 8.0 is supported to run on a GPU with compute capability 8.6, however a cubin generated for compute capability 8.6 is not supported to run on a GPU with compute capability 8.0, and a cubin generated with compute capability 8.x is not supported to run on a GPU with compute capability 9.0. Kernel can also be compiled to a PTX form. At the application load time, PTX is compiled to cubin and the cubin is used for kernel execution. Unlike cubin, PTX is forward-compatible. Meaning PTX is supported to run on any GPU with compute capability higher than the compute capability assumed for generation of that PTX. For example, PTX code generated for compute capability 8.x is supported to run on compute capability 8.x or any higher revision (major or minor), including compute capability 9.0. Therefore although it is optional, it is recommended that all applications should include PTX of the kernels to ensure forward-compatibility. To read more about cubin and PTX compatibilities see Compilation with NVCC from the CUDA C++ Programming Guide . When a CUDA application launches a kernel on a GPU, the CUDA Runtime determines the compute capability of the GPU in the system and uses this information to find the best matching cubin or PTX version of the kernel. If a cubin compatible with that GPU is present in the binary, the cubin is used as-is for execution. Otherwise, the CUDA Runtime first generates compatible cubin by JIT-compiling 1 the PTX and then the cubin is used for the execution. If neither compatible cubin nor PTX is available, kernel launch results in a failure. Application binaries that include PTX version of kernels, should work as-is on the Hopper GPUs. In such cases, rebuilding the application is not required. However application binaries which do not include PTX (only include cubins), need to be rebuilt to run on the Hopper GPUs. To know more about building compatible applications read Building Applications with Hopper Architecture Support Application binaries that include PTX version of kernels with architecture conditional features using sm_90a or compute_90a in order to take full advantage of Hopper GPU architecture, are not forward or backward compatible.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 3, "doc_id": 14, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#applications-built-using-cuda-toolkit-11-7-or-earlier", "display_name": "Applications Built Using CUDA Toolkit 11.7 or Earlier", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "applications-built-using-cuda-toolkit-11-7-or-earlier", "priority": -1, "content": "CUDA applications built using CUDA Toolkit versions 2.1 through 11.7 are compatible with Hopper GPUs as long as they are built to include PTX versions of their kernels. This can be tested by forcing the PTX to JIT-compile at application load time with following the steps: Download and install the latest driver from https://www.nvidia.com/drivers . Set the environment variable CUDA_FORCE_PTX_JIT=1 . Launch the application. With CUDA_FORCE_PTX_JIT=1 , GPU binary code embedded in an application binary is ignored. Instead PTX code for each kernel is JIT-compiled to produce GPU binary code. An application fails to execute if it does not include PTX. This means the application is not Hopper architecture compatible and needs to be rebuilt for compatibility.

For CUDA toolkits prior to 11.0, one or more of the -gencode options need to be removed according to the architectures supported by the specific toolkit version (for example, CUDA toolkit 10.x supports architectures up to sm_72 and sm_75).

All kernels which do not have native cubins are JIT-compiled from PTX, including kernels from all the libraries linked to the application, even if those kernels are never launched by the application 2 . Especially when using large libraries, this JIT compilation can take a significant amount of time. The CUDA driver caches the cubins generated as a result of the PTX JIT, so this is mostly a one-time cost for a user, but it is time best avoided whenever possible. PTX JIT-compiled kernels often cannot take advantage of architectural features of newer GPUs, meaning that native-compiled cubins may be faster or of greater accuracy.
