The cudaMemcpyAsync() function is a non-blocking variant of cudaMemcpy() in which control is returned immediately to the host thread. In contrast with cudaMemcpy() , the asynchronous transfer version requires pinned host memory (see Pinned Memory ), and it contains an additional argument, a stream ID. A stream is simply a sequence of operations that are performed in order on the device. Operations in different streams can be interleaved and in some cases overlapped - a property that can be used to hide data transfers between the host and the device. Asynchronous transfers enable overlap of data transfers with computation in two different ways. On all CUDA-enabled devices, it is possible to overlap host computation with asynchronous data transfers and with device computations. For example, Overlapping computation and data transfers demonstrates how host computation in the routine cpuFunction() is performed while data is transferred to the device and a kernel using the device is executed. Overlapping computation and data transfers cudaMemcpyAsync(a_d, a_h, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, 0); kernel&lt;&lt;&lt;grid, block&gt;&gt;&gt;(a_d); cpuFunction(); The last argument to the cudaMemcpyAsync() function is the stream ID, which in this case uses the default stream, stream 0. The kernel also uses the default stream, and it will not begin execution until the memory copy completes; therefore, no explicit synchronization is needed. Because the memory copy and the kernel both return control to the host immediately, the host function cpuFunction() overlaps their execution. In Overlapping computation and data transfers , the memory copy and kernel execution occur sequentially. On devices that are capable of concurrent copy and compute, it is possible to overlap kernel execution on the device with data transfers between the host and the device. Whether a device has this capability is indicated by the asyncEngineCount field of the cudaDeviceProp structure (or listed in the output of the deviceQuery CUDA Sample). On devices that have this capability, the overlap once again requires pinned host memory, and, in addition, the data transfer and kernel must use different, non-default streams (streams with non-zero stream IDs). Non-default streams are required for this overlap because memory copy, memory set functions, and kernel calls that use the default stream begin only after all preceding calls on the device (in any stream) have completed, and no operation on the device (in any stream) commences until they are finished. Concurrent copy and execute illustrates the basic technique. Concurrent copy and execute cudaStreamCreate(&amp;stream1); cudaStreamCreate(&amp;stream2); cudaMemcpyAsync(a_d, a_h, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream1); kernel&lt;&lt;&lt;grid, block, 0, stream2&gt;&gt;&gt;(otherData_d); In this code, two streams are created and used in the data transfer and kernel executions as specified in the last arguments of the cudaMemcpyAsync call and the kernel\u2019s execution configuration. Concurrent copy and execute demonstrates how to overlap kernel execution with asynchronous data transfer. This technique could be used when the data dependency is such that the data can be broken into chunks and transferred in multiple stages, launching multiple kernels to operate on each chunk as it arrives. Sequential copy and execute and Staged concurrent copy and execute demonstrate this. They produce equivalent results. The first segment shows the reference sequential implementation, which transfers and operates on an array of N floats (where N is assumed to be evenly divisible by nThreads). Sequential copy and execute cudaMemcpy(a_d, a_h, N*sizeof(float), dir); kernel&lt;&lt;&lt;N/nThreads, nThreads&gt;&gt;&gt;(a_d); Staged concurrent copy and execute shows how the transfer and kernel execution can be broken up into nStreams stages. This approach permits some overlapping of the data transfer and execution. Staged concurrent copy and execute size=N*sizeof(float)/nStreams; for (i=0; i&lt;nStreams; i++) { offset = i*N/nStreams; cudaMemcpyAsync(a_d+offset, a_h+offset, size, dir, stream[i]); kernel&lt;&lt;&lt;N/(nThreads*nStreams), nThreads, 0, stream[i]&gt;&gt;&gt;(a_d+offset); } (In Staged concurrent copy and execute , it is assumed that N is evenly divisible by nThreads*nStreams .) Because execution within a stream occurs sequentially, none of the kernels will launch until the data transfers in their respective streams complete. Current GPUs can simultaneously process asynchronous data transfers and execute kernels. GPUs with a single copy engine can perform one asynchronous data transfer and execute kernels whereas GPUs with two copy engines can simultaneously perform one asynchronous data transfer from the host to the device, one asynchronous data transfer from the device to the host, and execute kernels. The number of copy engines on a GPU is given by the asyncEngineCount field of the cudaDeviceProp structure, which is also listed in the output of the deviceQuery CUDA Sample. (It should be mentioned that it is not possible to overlap a blocking transfer with an asynchronous transfer, because the blocking transfer occurs in the default stream, so it will not begin until all previous CUDA calls complete. It will not allow any other CUDA call to begin until it has completed.) A diagram depicting the timeline of execution for the two code segments is shown in Figure 1 , and nStreams is equal to 4 for Staged concurrent copy and execute in the bottom half of the figure. Timeline comparison for copy and kernel execution Top Sequential Bottom Concurrent For this example, it is assumed that the data transfer and kernel execution times are comparable. In such cases, and when the execution time ( tE ) exceeds the transfer time ( tT ), a rough estimate for the overall time is tE + tT/nStreams for the staged version versus tE + tT for the sequential version. If the transfer time exceeds the execution time, a rough estimate for the overall time is tT + tE/nStreams .", "keywords": []}, {"id": 12, "doc_id": 128, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#asynchronous-copy-from-global-memory-to-shared-memory", "display_name": "Asynchronous Copy from Global Memory to Shared Memory", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "asynchronous-copy-from-global-memory-to-shared-memory", "priority": -1, "content": "CUDA 11.0 introduces an async-copy feature that can be used within device code to explicitly manage the asynchronous copying of data from global memory to shared memory. This feature enables CUDA kernels to overlap copying data from global to shared memory with computation. It also avoids an intermediary register file access traditionally present between the global memory read and the shared memory write. For more details refer to the memcpy_async section in the CUDA C++ Programming Guide . To understand the performance difference between synchronous copy and asynchronous copy of data from global memory to shared memory, consider the following micro benchmark CUDA kernels for demonstrating the synchronous and asynchronous approaches. Asynchronous copies are hardware accelerated for NVIDIA A100 GPU. template &lt;typename T&gt; __global__ void pipeline_kernel_sync(T *global, uint64_t *clock, size_t copy_count) { extern __shared__ char s[]; T *shared = reinterpret_cast&lt;T *&gt;(s); uint64_t clock_start = clock64(); for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; copy_count; ++i) { shared[blockDim.x * i + threadIdx.x] = global[blockDim.x * i + threadIdx.x]; } uint64_t clock_end = clock64(); atomicAdd(reinterpret_cast&lt;unsigned long long *&gt;(clock), clock_end - clock_start); } template &lt;typename T&gt; __global__ void pipeline_kernel_async(T *global, uint64_t *clock, size_t copy_count) { extern __shared__ char s[]; T *shared = reinterpret_cast&lt;T *&gt;(s); uint64_t clock_start = clock64(); //pipeline pipe; for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; copy_count; ++i) { __pipeline_memcpy_async(&amp;shared[blockDim.x * i + threadIdx.x], &amp;global[blockDim.x * i + threadIdx.x], sizeof(T)); } __pipeline_commit(); __pipeline_wait_prior(0); uint64_t clock_end = clock64(); atomicAdd(reinterpret_cast&lt;unsigned long long *&gt;(clock), clock_end - clock_start); } The synchronous version for the kernel loads an element from global memory to an intermediate register and then stores the intermediate register value to shared memory. In the asynchronous version of the kernel, instructions to load from global memory and store directly into shared memory are issued as soon as __pipeline_memcpy_async() function is called. The __pipeline_wait_prior(0) will wait until all the instructions in the pipe object have been executed. Using asynchronous copies does not use any intermediate register. Not using intermediate registers can help reduce register pressure and can increase kernel occupancy. Data copied from global memory to shared memory using asynchronous copy instructions can be cached in the L1 cache or the L1 cache can be optionally bypassed. If individual CUDA threads are copying elements of 16 bytes, the L1 cache can be bypassed. This difference is illustrated in Figure 13 . Comparing Synchronous vs Asynchronous Copy from Global Memory to Shared Memory We evaluate the performance of both kernels using elements of size 4B, 8B and 16B per thread i.e., using int , int2 and int4 for the template parameter. We adjust the copy_count in the kernels such that each thread block copies from 512 bytes up to 48 MB. The performance of the kernels is shown in Figure 14 . Comparing Performance of Synchronous vs Asynchronous Copy from Global Memory to Shared Memory From the performance chart, the following observations can be made for this experiment. Best performance with synchronous copy is achieved when the copy_count parameter is a multiple of 4 for all three element sizes. The compiler can optimize groups of 4 load and store instructions. This is evident from the saw tooth curves. Asynchronous copy achieves better performance in nearly all cases. The async-copy does not require the copy_count parameter to be a multiple of 4, to maximize performance through compiler optimizations. Overall, best performance is achieved when using asynchronous copies with an element of size 8 or 16 bytes.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 13, "doc_id": 128, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#bandwidth", "display_name": "Bandwidth", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "bandwidth", "priority": -1, "content": "Bandwidth - the rate at which data can be transferred - is one of the most important gating factors for performance.

The CUDA Driver API has a versioned C-style ABI, which guarantees that applications that were running against an older driver (for example CUDA 3.2) will still run and function correctly against a modern driver (for example one shipped with CUDA 11.0). This means that even though an application source might need to be changed if it has to be recompiled against a newer CUDA Toolkit in order to use the newer features, replacing the driver components installed in a system with a newer version will always support existing applications and its functions. The CUDA Driver API thus is binary-compatible (the OS loader can pick up a newer version and the application continues to work) but not source-compatible (rebuilding your application against a newer SDK might require source changes). CUDA Toolkit and Minimum Driver Versions Before we proceed further on this topic, it\u2019s important for developers to understand the concept of Minimum Driver Version and how that may affect them. Each version of the CUDA Toolkit (and runtime) requires a minimum version of the NVIDIA driver. Applications compiled against a CUDA Toolkit version will only run on systems with the specified minimum driver version for that toolkit version. Prior to CUDA 11.0, the minimum driver version for a toolkit was the same as the driver shipped with that version of the CUDA Toolkit. So, when an application is built with CUDA 11.0, it can only run on a system with an R450 or later driver. If such an application is run on a system with the R418 driver installed, CUDA initialization will return an error as can be seen in the example below. In this example, the deviceQuery sample is compiled with CUDA 11.1 and is run on a system with R418. In this scenario, CUDA initialization returns an error due to the minimum driver requirement. ubuntu@:~/samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery $ make /usr/local/cuda-11.1/bin/nvcc -ccbin g++ -I../../common/inc -m64 -gencode arch=compute_35,code=sm_35 -gencode arch=compute_37,code=sm_37 -gencode arch=compute_50,code=sm_50 -gencode arch=compute_52,code=sm_52 -gencode arch=compute_60,code=sm_60 -gencode arch=compute_61,code=sm_61 -gencode arch=compute_70,code=sm_70 -gencode arch=compute_75,code=sm_75 -gencode arch=compute_80,code=sm_80 -gencode arch=compute_86,code=sm_86 -gencode arch=compute_86,code=compute_86 -o deviceQuery.o -c deviceQuery.cpp /usr/local/cuda-11.1/bin/nvcc -ccbin g++ -m64 -gencode arch=compute_35,code=sm_35 -gencode arch=compute_37,code=sm_37 -gencode arch=compute_50,code=sm_50 -gencode arch=compute_52,code=sm_52 -gencode arch=compute_60,code=sm_60 -gencode arch=compute_61,code=sm_61 -gencode arch=compute_70,code=sm_70 -gencode arch=compute_75,code=sm_75 -gencode arch=compute_80,code=sm_80 -gencode arch=compute_86,code=sm_86 -gencode arch=compute_86,code=compute_86 -o deviceQuery deviceQuery.o $ nvidia-smi +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | NVIDIA-SMI 418.165.02 Driver Version: 418.165.02 CUDA Version: 10.1 | |-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | GPU Name Persistence-M| Bus-Id Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

If this happens, the different execution paths must be executed separately; this increases the total number of instructions executed for this warp. To obtain best performance in cases where the control flow depends on the thread ID, the controlling condition should be written so as to minimize the number of divergent warps. This is possible because the distribution of the warps across the block is deterministic as mentioned in SIMT Architecture of the CUDA C++ Programming Guide. A trivial example is when the controlling condition depends only on ( threadIdx / WSIZE ) where WSIZE is the warp size. In this case, no warp diverges because the controlling condition is perfectly aligned with the warps. For branches including just a few instructions, warp divergence generally results in marginal performance losses. For example, the compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Threads with a false predicate do not write results, and also do not evaluate addresses or read operands. Starting with the Volta architecture, Independent Thread Scheduling allows a warp to remain diverged outside of the data-dependent conditional block. An explicit __syncwarp() can be used to guarantee that the warp has reconverged for subsequent instructions.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 17, "doc_id": 128, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#building-for-maximum-compatibility", "display_name": "Building for Maximum Compatibility", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "building-for-maximum-compatibility", "priority": -1, "content": "Each generation of CUDA-capable device has an associated compute capability version that indicates the feature set supported by the device (see CUDA Compute Capability ).

Register storage enables threads to keep local variables nearby for low-latency access. However, the set of registers (known as the register file ) is a limited commodity that all threads resident on a multiprocessor must share. Registers are allocated to an entire block all at once. So, if each thread block uses many registers, the number of thread blocks that can be resident on a multiprocessor is reduced, thereby lowering the occupancy of the multiprocessor. The maximum number of registers per thread can be set manually at compilation time per-file using the -maxrregcount option or per-kernel using the __launch_bounds__ qualifier (see Register Pressure ). For purposes of calculating occupancy, the number of registers used by each thread is one of the key factors. For example, on devices of compute capability 7.0 each multiprocessor has 65,536 32-bit registers and can have a maximum of 2048 simultaneous threads resident (64 warps x 32 threads per warp). This means that in one of these devices, for a multiprocessor to have 100% occupancy, each thread can use at most 32 registers. However, this approach of determining how register count affects occupancy does not take into account the register allocation granularity. For example, on a device of compute capability 7.0, a kernel with 128-thread blocks using 37 registers per thread results in an occupancy of 75% with 12 active 128-thread blocks per multi-processor, whereas a kernel with 320-thread blocks using the same 37 registers per thread results in an occupancy of 63% because only four 320-thread blocks can reside on a multiprocessor. Furthermore, register allocations are rounded up to the nearest 256 registers per warp. The number of registers available, the maximum number of simultaneous threads resident on each multiprocessor, and the register allocation granularity vary over different compute capabilities. Because of these nuances in register allocation and the fact that a multiprocessor\u2019s shared memory is also partitioned between resident thread blocks, the exact relationship between register usage and occupancy can be difficult to determine. The --ptxas options=v option of nvcc details the number of registers used per thread for each kernel. See Hardware Multithreading of the CUDA C++ Programming Guide for the register allocation formulas for devices of various compute capabilities and Features and Technical Specifications of the CUDA C++ Programming Guide for the total number of registers available on those devices. Alternatively, NVIDIA provides an occupancy calculator in the form of an Excel spreadsheet that enables developers to hone in on the optimal balance and to test different possible scenarios more easily. This spreadsheet, shown in Figure 15 , is called CUDA_Occupancy_Calculator.xls and is located in the tools subdirectory of the CUDA Toolkit installation. Using the CUDA Occupancy Calculator to project GPU multiprocessor occupancy In addition to the calculator spreadsheet, occupancy can be determined using the NVIDIA Nsight Compute Profiler.

For devices of compute capability 6.0 or higher, the requirements can be summarized quite easily: the concurrent accesses of the threads of a warp will coalesce into a number of transactions equal to the number of 32-byte transactions necessary to service all of the threads of the warp. For certain devices of compute capability 5.2, L1-caching of accesses to global memory can be optionally enabled.

Compatibility of the CUDA platform is thus intended to address a few scenarios: NVIDIA driver upgrades to systems with GPUs running in production for enterprises or datacenters can be complex and may need advance planning. Delays in rolling out new NVIDIA drivers could mean that users of such systems may not have access to new features available in CUDA releases. Not requiring driver updates for new CUDA releases can mean that new versions of the software can be made available faster to users. Many software libraries and applications built on top of CUDA (e.g. math libraries or deep learning frameworks) do not have a direct dependency on the CUDA runtime, compiler or driver.

For example, servers that have two 32 core processors can run only 64 threads concurrently (or small multiple of that if the CPUs support simultaneous multithreading). By comparison, the smallest executable unit of parallelism on a CUDA device comprises 32 threads (termed a warp of threads). Modern NVIDIA GPUs can support up to 2048 active threads concurrently per multiprocessor (see Features and Specifications of the CUDA C++ Programming Guide) On GPUs with 80 multiprocessors, this leads to more than 160,000 concurrently active threads. Threads Threads on a CPU are generally heavyweight entities. The operating system must swap threads on and off CPU execution channels to provide multithreading capability. Context switches (when two threads are swapped) are therefore slow and expensive. By comparison, threads on GPUs are extremely lightweight. In a typical system, thousands of threads are queued up for work (in warps of 32 threads each). If the GPU must wait on one warp of threads, it simply begins executing work on another. Because separate registers are allocated to all active threads, no swapping of registers or other state need occur when switching among GPU threads. Resources stay allocated to each thread until it completes its execution. In short, CPU cores are designed to minimize latency for a small number of threads at a time each, whereas GPUs are designed to handle a large number of concurrent, lightweight threads in order to maximize throughput . RAM The host system and the device each have their own distinct attached physical memories 1 . As the host and device memories are separated, items in the host memory must occasionally be communicated between device memory and host memory as described in What Runs on a CUDA-Enabled Device? . These are the primary hardware differences between CPU hosts and GPU devices with respect to parallel programming. Other differences are discussed as they arise elsewhere in this document.

Unlike the CUDA Driver, the CUDA Runtime guarantees neither forward nor backward binary compatibility across versions. It is therefore best to redistribute the CUDA Runtime library with the application when using dynamic linking or else to statically link against the CUDA Runtime. This will ensure that the executable will be able to run even if the user does not have the same CUDA Toolkit installed that the application was built against. When statically linking to the CUDA Runtime, multiple versions of the runtime can peacably coexist in the same application process simultaneously; for example, if an application uses one version of the CUDA Runtime, and a plugin to that application is statically linked to a different version, that is perfectly acceptable, as long as the installed NVIDIA Driver is sufficient for both. Statically-linked CUDA Runtime The easiest option is to statically link against the CUDA Runtime. This is the default if using nvcc to link in CUDA 5.5 and later. Static linking makes the executable slightly larger, but it ensures that the correct version of runtime library functions are included in the application binary without requiring separate redistribution of the CUDA Runtime library.

After the application is dynamically linked against the CUDA Runtime, this version of the runtime library should be bundled with the application. It can be copied into the same directory as the application executable or into a subdirectory of that installation path.

Dealing with relocatable objects is not yet supported, therefore the cuLink * set of APIs in the CUDA driver will not work with enhanced compatibility. An upgraded driver matching the CUDA runtime version is currently required for those APIs. As mentioned in the PTX section, the compilation of PTX to device code lives along with the CUDA driver, hence the generated PTX might be newer than what is supported by the driver on the deployment system. When using NVRTC, it is recommended that the resulting PTX code is first transformed to the final device code via the steps outlined by the PTX user workflow. This ensures your code is compatible. Alternatively, NVRTC can generate cubins directly starting with CUDA 11.1. Applications using the new API can load the final device code directly using driver APIs cuModuleLoadData and cuModuleLoadDataEx . NVRTC used to support only virtual architectures through the option -arch, since it was only emitting PTX. It will now support actual architectures as well to emit SASS.

However, it also can act as a constraint on occupancy. In many cases, the amount of shared memory required by a kernel is related to the block size that was chosen, but the mapping of threads to shared memory elements does not need to be one-to-one. For example, it may be desirable to use a 64x64 element shared memory array in a kernel, but because the maximum number of threads per block is 1024, it is not possible to launch a kernel with 64x64 threads per block. In such cases, kernels with 32x32 or 64x16 threads can be launched with each thread processing four elements of the shared memory array. The approach of using a single thread to process multiple elements of a shared memory array can be beneficial even if limits such as threads per block are not an issue. This is because some operations common to each element can be performed by the thread once, amortizing the cost over the number of shared memory elements processed by the thread. A useful technique to determine the sensitivity of performance to occupancy is through experimentation with the amount of dynamically allocated shared memory, as specified in the third parameter of the execution configuration.

Users wishing to take advantage of such a feature should query its availability with a dynamic check in the code: static bool hostRegisterFeatureSupported = false; static bool hostRegisterIsDeviceAddress = false; static error_t cuFooFunction(int *ptr) { int *dptr = null; if (hostRegisterFeatureSupported) { cudaHostRegister(ptr, size, flags); if (hostRegisterIsDeviceAddress) { qptr = ptr; } else { cudaHostGetDevicePointer(&amp;qptr, ptr, 0); } } else { // cudaMalloc(); // cudaMemcpy(); } gemm&lt;&lt;&lt;1,1&gt;&gt;&gt;(dptr); cudaDeviceSynchronize(); } int main() { // rest of code here cudaDeviceGetAttribute( &amp;hostRegisterFeatureSupported, cudaDevAttrHostRegisterSupported, 0); cudaDeviceGetAttribute( &amp;hostRegisterIsDeviceAddress, cudaDevAttrCanUseHostPointerForRegisteredMem, 0); cuFooFunction(/* malloced pointer */); } Alternatively the application\u2019s interface might not work at all without a new CUDA driver and then its best to return an error right away: #define MIN_VERSION 11010 cudaError_t foo() { int version = 0; cudaGetDriverVersion(&amp;version); if (version &lt; MIN_VERSION) { return CUDA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_DRIVER; } // proceed as normal } A new error code is added to indicate that the functionality is missing from the driver you are running against: cudaErrorCallRequiresNewerDriver .", "keywords": []}, {"id": 54, "doc_id": 128, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#heterogeneous-computing", "display_name": "Heterogeneous Computing", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "heterogeneous-computing", "priority": -1, "content": "CUDA programming involves running code on two different platforms concurrently: a host system with one or more CPUs and one or more CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU devices .

Local memory is used only to hold automatic variables. This is done by the nvcc compiler when it determines that there is insufficient register space to hold the variable. Automatic variables that are likely to be placed in local memory are large structures or arrays that would consume too much register space and arrays that the compiler determines may be indexed dynamically. Inspection of the PTX assembly code (obtained by compiling with -ptx or -keep command-line options to nvcc ) reveals whether a variable has been placed in local memory during the first compilation phases.

This is of particular note with loop counters: since it is common for loop counters to have values that are always positive, it may be tempting to declare the counters as unsigned. For slightly better performance, however, they should instead be declared as signed. For example, consider the following code: for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) { out[i] = in[offset + stride*i]; } Here, the sub-expression stride*i could overflow a 32-bit integer, so if i is declared as unsigned, the overflow semantics prevent the compiler from using some optimizations that might otherwise have applied, such as strength reduction.

Two types of runtime math operations are supported. They can be distinguished by their names: some have names with prepended underscores, whereas others do not (e.g., __functionName() versus functionName() ). Functions following the __functionName() naming convention map directly to the hardware level. They are faster but provide somewhat lower accuracy (e.g., __sinf(x) and __expf(x) ). Functions following functionName() naming convention are slower but have higher accuracy (e.g., sinf(x) and expf(x) ). The throughput of __sinf(x) , __cosf(x) , and __expf(x) is much greater than that of sinf(x) , cosf(x) , and expf(x) . The latter become even more expensive (about an order of magnitude slower) if the magnitude of the argument x needs to be reduced. Moreover, in such cases, the argument-reduction code uses local memory, which can affect performance even more because of the high latency of local memory. More details are available in the CUDA C++ Programming Guide . Note also that whenever sine and cosine of the same argument are computed, the sincos family of instructions should be used to optimize performance: __sincosf() for single-precision fast math (see next paragraph) sincosf() for regular single-precision sincos() for double precision The -use_fast_math compiler option of nvcc coerces every functionName() call to the equivalent __functionName() call. It also disables single-precision denormal support and lowers the precision of single-precision division in general. This is an aggressive optimization that can both reduce numerical accuracy and alter special case handling. A more robust approach is to selectively introduce calls to fast intrinsic functions only if merited by performance gains and where altered behavior can be tolerated. Note this switch is effective only on single-precision floating point. Medium Priority: Prefer faster, more specialized math functions over slower, more general ones when possible. For small integer powers (e.g., x2 or x3 ), explicit multiplication is almost certainly faster than the use of general exponentiation routines such as pow() . While compiler optimization improvements continually seek to narrow this gap, explicit multiplication (or the use of an equivalent purpose-built inline function or macro) can have a significant advantage. This advantage is increased when several powers of the same base are needed (e.g., where both x2 and x5 are calculated in close proximity), as this aids the compiler in its common sub-expression elimination (CSE) optimization. For exponentiation using base 2 or 10, use the functions exp2() or expf2() and exp10() or expf10() rather than the functions pow() or powf() . Both pow() and powf() are heavy-weight functions in terms of register pressure and instruction count due to the numerous special cases arising in general exponentiation and the difficulty of achieving good accuracy across the entire ranges of the base and the exponent. The functions exp2() , exp2f() , exp10() , and exp10f() , on the other hand, are similar to exp() and expf() in terms of performance, and can be as much as ten times faster than their pow() / powf() equivalents. For exponentiation with an exponent of 1/3, use the cbrt() or cbrtf() function rather than the generic exponentiation functions pow() or powf() , as the former are significantly faster than the latter. Likewise, for exponentation with an exponent of -1/3, use rcbrt() or rcbrtf() . Replace sin(\u03c0*&lt;expr&gt;) with sinpi(&lt;expr&gt;) , cos(\u03c0*&lt;expr&gt;) with cospi(&lt;expr&gt;) , and sincos(\u03c0*&lt;expr&gt;) with sincospi(&lt;expr&gt;) . This is advantageous with regard to both accuracy and performance. As a particular example, to evaluate the sine function in degrees instead of radians, use sinpi(x/180.0) . Similarly, the single-precision functions sinpif() , cospif() , and sincospif() should replace calls to sinf() , cosf() , and sincosf() when the function argument is of the form \u03c0*&lt;expr&gt; . (The performance advantage sinpi() has over sin() is due to simplified argument reduction; the accuracy advantage is because sinpi() multiplies by \u03c0 only implicitly, effectively using an infinitely precise mathematical \u03c0 rather than a single- or double-precision approximation thereof.)", "keywords": []}, {"id": 65, "doc_id": 128, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#memory-instructions", "display_name": "Memory Instructions", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "memory-instructions", "priority": -1, "content": "High Priority: Minimize the use of global memory.

The context encapsulates kernel launches and memory allocations for that GPU as well as supporting constructs such as the page tables. The context is explicit in the CUDA Driver API but is entirely implicit in the CUDA Runtime API, which creates and manages contexts automatically. With the CUDA Driver API, a CUDA application process can potentially create more than one context for a given GPU. If multiple CUDA application processes access the same GPU concurrently, this almost always implies multiple contexts, since a context is tied to a particular host process unless Multi-Process Service is in use. While multiple contexts (and their associated resources such as global memory allocations) can be allocated concurrently on a given GPU, only one of these contexts can execute work at any given moment on that GPU; contexts sharing the same GPU are time-sliced. Creating additional contexts incurs memory overhead for per-context data and time overhead for context switching. Furthermore, the need for context switching can reduce utilization when work from several contexts could otherwise execute concurrently (see also Concurrent Kernel Execution ). Therefore, it is best to avoid multiple contexts per GPU within the same CUDA application. To assist with this, the CUDA Driver API provides methods to access and manage a special context on each GPU called the primary context .

Higher occupancy does not always equate to higher performance-there is a point above which additional occupancy does not improve performance. However, low occupancy always interferes with the ability to hide memory latency, resulting in performance degradation. Per thread resources required by a CUDA kernel might limit the maximum block size in an unwanted way. In order to maintain forward compatibility to future hardware and toolkits and to ensure that at least one thread block can run on an SM, developers should include the single argument __launch_bounds__(maxThreadsPerBlock) which specifies the largest block size that the kernel will be launched with. Failure to do so could lead to \u201ctoo many resources requested for launch\u201d errors. Providing the two argument version of __launch_bounds__(maxThreadsPerBlock,minBlocksPerMultiprocessor) can improve performance in some cases. The right value for minBlocksPerMultiprocessor should be determined using a detailed per kernel analysis.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 76, "doc_id": 128, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#opencl", "display_name": "OpenCL", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "opencl", "priority": -1, "content": "OpenCL is a trademark of Apple Inc. used under license to the Khronos Group Inc.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 77, "doc_id": 128, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#optimize", "display_name": "Optimize", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "optimize", "priority": -1, "content": "After each round of application parallelization is complete, the developer can move to optimizing the implementation to improve performance.

Once the parallelism of the algorithm has been exposed, it needs to be mapped to the hardware as efficiently as possible. This is done by carefully choosing the execution configuration of each kernel launch. The application should also maximize parallel execution at a higher level by explicitly exposing concurrent execution on the device through streams, as well as maximizing concurrent execution between the host and the device. Optimizing memory usage starts with minimizing data transfers between the host and the device because those transfers have much lower bandwidth than internal device data transfers. Kernel access to global memory also should be minimized by maximizing the use of shared memory on the device. Sometimes, the best optimization might even be to avoid any data transfer in the first place by simply recomputing the data whenever it is needed. The effective bandwidth can vary by an order of magnitude depending on the access pattern for each type of memory. The next step in optimizing memory usage is therefore to organize memory accesses according to the optimal memory access patterns. This optimization is especially important for global memory accesses, because latency of access costs hundreds of clock cycles. Shared memory accesses, in counterpoint, are usually worth optimizing only when there exists a high degree of bank conflicts. As for optimizing instruction usage, the use of arithmetic instructions that have low throughput should be avoided. This suggests trading precision for speed when it does not affect the end result, such as using intrinsics instead of regular functions or single precision instead of double precision.

The effective bandwidth for this kernel is 12.8 GB/s on an NVIDIA Tesla V100. These results are substantially lower than the corresponding measurements for the C = AB kernel. The difference is in how threads in a half warp access elements of A in the second term, a[col*TILE_DIM+i] , for each iteration i . For a warp of threads, col represents sequential columns of the transpose of A, and therefore col*TILE_DIM represents a strided access of global memory with a stride of w, resulting in plenty of wasted bandwidth. The way to avoid strided access is to use shared memory as before, except in this case a warp reads a row of A into a column of a shared memory tile, as shown in An optimized handling of strided accesses using coalesced reads from global memory . An optimized handling of strided accesses using coalesced reads from global memory __global__ void coalescedMultiply(float *a, float *c, int M) { __shared__ float aTile[TILE_DIM][TILE_DIM], transposedTile[TILE_DIM][TILE_DIM]; int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y; int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x; float sum = 0.0f; aTile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = a[row*TILE_DIM+threadIdx.x]; transposedTile[threadIdx.x][threadIdx.y] = a[(blockIdx.x*blockDim.x + threadIdx.y)*TILE_DIM + threadIdx.x]; __syncthreads(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; TILE_DIM; i++) { sum += aTile[threadIdx.y][i]* transposedTile[i][threadIdx.x]; } c[row*M+col] = sum; } An optimized handling of strided accesses using coalesced reads from global memory uses the shared transposedTile to avoid uncoalesced accesses in the second term in the dot product and the shared aTile technique from the previous example to avoid uncoalesced accesses in the first term. The effective bandwidth of this kernel is 140.2 GB/s on an NVIDIA Tesla V100.These results are lower than those obtained by the final kernel for C = AB. The cause of the difference is shared memory bank conflicts. The reads of elements in transposedTile within the for loop are free of conflicts, because threads of each half warp read across rows of the tile, resulting in unit stride across the banks. However, bank conflicts occur when copying the tile from global memory into shared memory. To enable the loads from global memory to be coalesced, data are read from global memory sequentially. However, this requires writing to shared memory in columns, and because of the use of wxw tiles in shared memory, this results in a stride between threads of w banks - every thread of the warp hits the same bank (Recall that w is selected as 32). These many-way bank conflicts are very expensive. The simple remedy is to pad the shared memory array so that it has an extra column, as in the following line of code. __shared__ float transposedTile[TILE_DIM][TILE_DIM+1]; This padding eliminates the conflicts entirely, because now the stride between threads is w+1 banks (i.e., 33 for current devices), which, due to modulo arithmetic used to compute bank indices, is equivalent to a unit stride. After this change, the effective bandwidth is 199.4 GB/s on an NVIDIA Tesla V100, which is comparable to the results from the last C = AB kernel. The results of these optimizations are summarized in Table 3 . Optimization NVIDIA Tesla V100 No optimization 12.8 GB/s Using shared memory to coalesce global reads 140.2 GB/s Removing bank conflicts 199.4 GB/s These results should be compared with those in Table 2 . As can be seen from these tables, judicious use of shared memory can dramatically improve performance.

Shared memory can also be used to avoid uncoalesced memory accesses by loading and storing data in a coalesced pattern from global memory and then reordering it in shared memory. Aside from memory bank conflicts, there is no penalty for non-sequential or unaligned accesses by a warp in shared memory. The use of shared memory is illustrated via the simple example of a matrix multiplication C = AB for the case with A of dimension Mxw, B of dimension wxN, and C of dimension MxN. To keep the kernels simple, M and N are multiples of 32, since the warp size (w) is 32 for current devices. A natural decomposition of the problem is to use a block and tile size of wxw threads. Therefore, in terms of wxw tiles, A is a column matrix, B is a row matrix, and C is their outer product; see Figure 11 . A grid of N/w by M/w blocks is launched, where each thread block calculates the elements of a different tile in C from a single tile of A and a single tile of B. Block-column matrix multiplied by block-row matrix. Block-column matrix (A) multiplied by block-row matrix (B) with resulting product matrix (C). To do this, the simpleMultiply kernel ( Unoptimized matrix multiplication ) calculates the output elements of a tile of matrix C. Unoptimized matrix multiplication __global__ void simpleMultiply(float *a, float* b, float *c, int N) { int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y; int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x; float sum = 0.0f; for (int i = 0; i &lt; TILE_DIM; i++) { sum += a[row*TILE_DIM+i] * b[i*N+col]; } c[row*N+col] = sum; } In Unoptimized matrix multiplication , a , b , and c are pointers to global memory for the matrices A, B, and C, respectively; blockDim.x , blockDim.y , and TILE_DIM are all equal to w. Each thread in the wxw-thread block calculates one element in a tile of C. row and col are the row and column of the element in C being calculated by a particular thread. The for loop over i multiplies a row of A by a column of B, which is then written to C. The effective bandwidth of this kernel is 119.9 GB/s on an NVIDIA Tesla V100. To analyze performance, it is necessary to consider how warps access global memory in the for loop. Each warp of threads calculates one row of a tile of C, which depends on a single row of A and an entire tile of B as illustrated in Figure 12 . Computing a row of a tile. Computing a row of a tile in C using one row of A and an entire tile of B. For each iteration i of the for loop, the threads in a warp read a row of the B tile, which is a sequential and coalesced access for all compute capabilities. However, for each iteration i , all threads in a warp read the same value from global memory for matrix A, as the index row*TILE_DIM+i is constant within a warp. Even though such an access requires only 1 transaction on devices of compute capability 2.0 or higher, there is wasted bandwidth in the transaction, because only one 4-byte word out of 8 words in a 32-byte cache segment is used. We can reuse this cache line in subsequent iterations of the loop, and we would eventually utilize all 8 words; however, when many warps execute on the same multiprocessor simultaneously, as is generally the case, the cache line may easily be evicted from the cache between iterations i and i+1 . The performance on a device of any compute capability can be improved by reading a tile of A into shared memory as shown in Using shared memory to improve the global memory load efficiency in matrix multiplication . Using shared memory to improve the global memory load efficiency in matrix multiplication __global__ void coalescedMultiply(float *a, float* b, float *c, int N) { __shared__ float aTile[TILE_DIM][TILE_DIM]; int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y; int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x; float sum = 0.0f; aTile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = a[row*TILE_DIM+threadIdx.x]; __syncwarp(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; TILE_DIM; i++) { sum += aTile[threadIdx.y][i]* b[i*N+col]; } c[row*N+col] = sum; } In Using shared memory to improve the global memory load efficiency in matrix multiplication , each element in a tile of A is read from global memory only once, in a fully coalesced fashion (with no wasted bandwidth), to shared memory. Within each iteration of the for loop, a value in shared memory is broadcast to all threads in a warp. Instead of a __syncthreads() synchronization barrier call, a __syncwarp() is sufficient after reading the tile of A into shared memory because only threads within the warp that write the data into shared memory read this data. This kernel has an effective bandwidth of 144.4 GB/s on an NVIDIA Tesla V100. This illustrates the use of the shared memory as a user-managed cache when the hardware L1 cache eviction policy does not match up well with the needs of the application or when L1 cache is not used for reads from global memory. A further improvement can be made to how Using shared memory to improve the global memory load efficiency in matrix multiplication deals with matrix B. In calculating each of the rows of a tile of matrix C, the entire tile of B is read. The repeated reading of the B tile can be eliminated by reading it into shared memory once ( Improvement by reading additional data into shared memory ). Improvement by reading additional data into shared memory __global__ void sharedABMultiply(float *a, float* b, float *c, int N) { __shared__ float aTile[TILE_DIM][TILE_DIM], bTile[TILE_DIM][TILE_DIM]; int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y; int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x; float sum = 0.0f; aTile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = a[row*TILE_DIM+threadIdx.x]; bTile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = b[threadIdx.y*N+col]; __syncthreads(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; TILE_DIM; i++) { sum += aTile[threadIdx.y][i]* bTile[i][threadIdx.x]; } c[row*N+col] = sum; } Note that in Improvement by reading additional data into shared memory , a __syncthreads() call is required after reading the B tile because a warp reads data from shared memory that were written to shared memory by different warps. The effective bandwidth of this routine is 195.5 GB/s on an NVIDIA Tesla V100. Note that the performance improvement is not due to improved coalescing in either case, but to avoiding redundant transfers from global memory.

To illustrate the effect of strided access on effective bandwidth, see the kernel strideCopy() in A kernel to illustrate non-unit stride data copy , which copies data with a stride of stride elements between threads from idata to odata .

This action leads to a load of eight L2 cache segments per warp on the Tesla V100 (compute capability 7.0).

An application that exhibits linear strong scaling has a speedup equal to the number of processors used. Strong scaling is usually equated with Amdahl\u2019s Law, which specifies the maximum speedup that can be expected by parallelizing portions of a serial program. Essentially, it states that the maximum speedup S of a program is: S = \\frac{1}{(1 - P) + \\frac{P}{N}} Here P is the fraction of the total serial execution time taken by the portion of code that can be parallelized and N is the number of processors over which the parallel portion of the code runs. The larger N is(that is, the greater the number of processors), the smaller the P/N fraction. It can be simpler to view N as a very large number, which essentially transforms the equation into S = 1/(1 - P) . Now, if 3/4 of the running time of a sequential program is parallelized, the maximum speedup over serial code is 1 / (1 - 3/4) = 4. In reality, most applications do not exhibit perfectly linear strong scaling, even if they do exhibit some degree of strong scaling. For most purposes, the key point is that the larger the parallelizable portion P is, the greater the potential speedup. Conversely, if P is a small number (meaning that the application is not substantially parallelizable), increasing the number of processors N does little to improve performance.

The dimension and size of blocks per grid and the dimension and size of threads per block are both important factors. The multidimensional aspect of these parameters allows easier mapping of multidimensional problems to CUDA and does not play a role in performance. As a result, this section discusses size but not dimension. Latency hiding and occupancy depend on the number of active warps per multiprocessor, which is implicitly determined by the execution parameters along with resource (register and shared memory) constraints. Choosing execution parameters is a matter of striking a balance between latency hiding (occupancy) and resource utilization. Choosing the execution configuration parameters should be done in tandem; however, there are certain heuristics that apply to each parameter individually. When choosing the first execution configuration parameter-the number of blocks per grid, or grid size - the primary concern is keeping the entire GPU busy. The number of blocks in a grid should be larger than the number of multiprocessors so that all multiprocessors have at least one block to execute. Furthermore, there should be multiple active blocks per multiprocessor so that blocks that aren\u2019t waiting for a __syncthreads() can keep the hardware busy. This recommendation is subject to resource availability; therefore, it should be determined in the context of the second execution parameter - the number of threads per block, or block size - as well as shared memory usage. To scale to future devices, the number of blocks per kernel launch should be in the thousands. When choosing the block size, it is important to remember that multiple concurrent blocks can reside on a multiprocessor, so occupancy is not determined by block size alone. In particular, a larger block size does not imply a higher occupancy. As mentioned in Occupancy , higher occupancy does not always equate to better performance. For example, improving occupancy from 66 percent to 100 percent generally does not translate to a similar increase in performance. A lower occupancy kernel will have more registers available per thread than a higher occupancy kernel, which may result in less register spilling to local memory; in particular, with a high degree of exposed instruction-level parallelism (ILP) it is, in some cases, possible to fully cover latency with a low occupancy. There are many such factors involved in selecting block size, and inevitably some experimentation is required. However, a few rules of thumb should be followed: Threads per block should be a multiple of warp size to avoid wasting computation on under-populated warps and to facilitate coalescing. A minimum of 64 threads per block should be used, and only if there are multiple concurrent blocks per multiprocessor. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation with different block sizes. Use several smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads() . Note that when a thread block allocates more registers than are available on a multiprocessor, the kernel launch fails, as it will when too much shared memory or too many threads are requested.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 109, "doc_id": 128, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#throughput-reported-by-visual-profiler", "display_name": "Throughput Reported by Visual Profiler", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "throughput-reported-by-visual-profiler", "priority": -1, "content": "For devices with compute capability of 2.0 or greater, the Visual Profiler can be used to collect several different memory throughput measures.

To understand the effect of hitRatio and num_bytes , we use a sliding window micro benchmark. This microbenchmark uses a 1024 MB region in GPU global memory. First, we set aside 30 MB of the L2 cache for persisting accesses using cudaDeviceSetLimit() , as discussed above. Then, as shown in the figure below, we specify that the accesses to the first freqSize * sizeof(int) bytes of the memory region are persistent. This data will thus use the L2 set-aside portion. In our experiment, we vary the size of this persistent data region from 10 MB to 60 MB to model various scenarios where data fits in or exceeds the available L2 set-aside portion of 30 MB. Note that the NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPU has 40 MB of total L2 cache capacity.

However, once the size of this persistent data region exceeds the size of the L2 set-aside cache portion, approximately 10% performance drop is observed due to thrashing of L2 cache lines. The performance of the sliding-window benchmark with fixed hit-ratio of 1.0 In order to optimize the performance, when the size of the persistent data is more than the size of the set-aside L2 cache portion, we tune the num_bytes and hitRatio parameters in the access window as below. stream_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.base_ptr = reinterpret_cast&lt;void*&gt;(data_persistent); stream_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.num_bytes = 20*1024*1024; //20 MB stream_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.hitRatio = (20*1024*1024)/((float)freqSize*sizeof(int)); //Such that up to 20MB of data is resident.

For example, we can write our CUDA kernels as a collection of many short __device__ functions rather than one large monolithic __global__ function; each device function can be tested independently before hooking them all together. For example, many kernels have complex addressing logic for accessing memory in addition to their actual computation. If we validate our addressing logic separately prior to introducing the bulk of the computation, then this will simplify any later debugging efforts. (Note that the CUDA compiler considers any device code that does not contribute to a write to global memory as dead code subject to elimination, so we must at least write something out to global memory as a result of our addressing logic in order to successfully apply this strategy.) Going a step further, if most functions are defined as __host__ __device__ rather than just __device__ functions, then these functions can be tested on both the CPU and the GPU, thereby increasing our confidence that the function is correct and that there will not be any unexpected differences in the results. If there are differences, then those differences will be seen early and can be understood in the context of a simple function. As a useful side effect, this strategy will allow us a means to reduce code duplication should we wish to include both CPU and GPU execution paths in our application: if the bulk of the work of our CUDA kernels is done in __host__ __device__ functions, we can easily call those functions from both the host code and the device code without duplication.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 117, "doc_id": 128, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#using-cpu-timers", "display_name": "Using CPU Timers", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "using-cpu-timers", "priority": -1, "content": "Any CPU timer can be used to measure the elapsed time of a CUDA call or kernel execution. The details of various CPU timing approaches are outside the scope of this document, but developers should always be aware of the resolution their timing calls provide. When using CPU timers, it is critical to remember that many CUDA API functions are asynchronous; that is, they return control back to the calling CPU thread prior to completing their work. All kernel launches are asynchronous, as are memory-copy functions with the Async suffix on their names. Therefore, to accurately measure the elapsed time for a particular call or sequence of CUDA calls, it is necessary to synchronize the CPU thread with the GPU by calling cudaDeviceSynchronize() immediately before starting and stopping the CPU timer. cudaDeviceSynchronize() blocks the calling CPU thread until all CUDA calls previously issued by the thread are completed. Although it is also possible to synchronize the CPU thread with a particular stream or event on the GPU, these synchronization functions are not suitable for timing code in streams other than the default stream. cudaStreamSynchronize() blocks the CPU thread until all CUDA calls previously issued into the given stream have completed. cudaEventSynchronize() blocks until a given event in a particular stream has been recorded by the GPU. Because the driver may interleave execution of CUDA calls from other non-default streams, calls in other streams may be included in the timing. Because the default stream, stream 0, exhibits serializing behavior for work on the device (an operation in the default stream can begin only after all preceding calls in any stream have completed; and no subsequent operation in any stream can begin until it finishes), these functions can be used reliably for timing in the default stream.

This is not a problem when PTX is used for future device compatibility (the most common case), but can lead to issues when used for runtime compilation. For codes continuing to make use of PTX, in order to support compiling on an older driver, your code must be first transformed into device code via the static ptxjitcompiler library or NVRTC with the option of generating code for a specific architecture (e.g. sm_80) rather than a virtual architecture (e.g. compute_80).

Because of this, the maximum speedup S of a program is: S = N + (1 - P)(1 - N) Here P is the fraction of the total serial execution time taken by the portion of code that can be parallelized and N is the number of processors over which the parallel portion of the code runs.

This typically involves arithmetic on large data sets (such as matrices) where the same operation can be performed across thousands, if not millions, of elements at the same time. This is a requirement for good performance on CUDA: the software must use a large number (generally thousands or tens of thousands) of concurrent threads. The support for running numerous threads in parallel derives from CUDA\u2019s use of a lightweight threading model described above. To use CUDA, data values must be transferred from the host to the device. These transfers are costly in terms of performance and should be minimized. (See Data Transfer Between Host and Device .) This cost has several ramifications: The complexity of operations should justify the cost of moving data to and from the device. Code that transfers data for brief use by a small number of threads will see little or no performance benefit. The ideal scenario is one in which many threads perform a substantial amount of work. For example, transferring two matrices to the device to perform a matrix addition and then transferring the results back to the host will not realize much performance benefit. The issue here is the number of operations performed per data element transferred. For the preceding procedure, assuming matrices of size NxN, there are N 2 operations (additions) and 3N 2 elements transferred, so the ratio of operations to elements transferred is 1:3 or O(1). Performance benefits can be more readily achieved when this ratio is higher. For example, a matrix multiplication of the same matrices requires N 3 operations (multiply-add), so the ratio of operations to elements transferred is O(N), in which case the larger the matrix the greater the performance benefit. The types of operations are an additional factor, as additions have different complexity profiles than, for example, trigonometric functions. It is important to include the overhead of transferring data to and from the device in determining whether operations should be performed on the host or on the device. Data should be kept on the device as long as possible. Because transfers should be minimized, programs that run multiple kernels on the same data should favor leaving the data on the device between kernel calls, rather than transferring intermediate results to the host and then sending them back to the device for subsequent calculations. So, in the previous example, had the two matrices to be added already been on the device as a result of some previous calculation, or if the results of the addition would be used in some subsequent calculation, the matrix addition should be performed locally on the device. This approach should be used even if one of the steps in a sequence of calculations could be performed faster on the host. Even a relatively slow kernel may be advantageous if it avoids one or more transfers between host and device memory. Data Transfer Between Host and Device provides further details, including the measurements of bandwidth between the host and the device versus within the device proper. For best performance, there should be some coherence in memory access by adjacent threads running on the device. Certain memory access patterns enable the hardware to coalesce groups of reads or writes of multiple data items into one operation. Data that cannot be laid out so as to enable coalescing , or that doesn\u2019t have enough locality to use the L1 or texture caches effectively, will tend to see lesser speedups when used in computations on GPUs. A noteworthy exception to this are completely random memory access patterns. In general, they should be avoided, because compared to peak capabilities any architecture processes these memory access patterns at a low efficiency. However, compared to cache based architectures, like CPUs, latency hiding architectures, like GPUs, tend to cope better with completely random memory access patterns. 1 On Systems on a Chip with integrated GPUs, such as NVIDIA\u00ae Tegra\u00ae, host and device memory are physically the same, but there is still a logical distinction between host and device memory.

The following examples use the cuBLAS library from CUDA Toolkit 5.5 as an illustration: Linux In a shared library on Linux, there is a string field called the SONAME that indicates the binary compatibility level of the library. The SONAME of the library against which the application was built must match the filename of the library that is redistributed with the application. For example, in the standard CUDA Toolkit installation, the files libcublas.so and libcublas.so.5.5 are both symlinks pointing to a specific build of cuBLAS, which is named like libcublas.so.5.5.x , where x is the build number (e.g., libcublas.so.5.5.17 ). However, the SONAME of this library is given as \u201c libcublas.so.5.5 \u201d: $ objdump -p /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcublas.so | grep SONAME SONAME libcublas.so.5.5 Because of this, even if -lcublas (with no version number specified) is used when linking the application, the SONAME found at link time implies that \u201c libcublas.so.5.5 \u201d is the name of the file that the dynamic loader will look for when loading the application and therefore must be the name of the file (or a symlink to the same) that is redistributed with the application. The ldd tool is useful for identifying the exact filenames of the libraries that the application expects to find at runtime as well as the path, if any, of the copy of that library that the dynamic loader would select when loading the application given the current library search path: $ ldd a.out | grep libcublas libcublas.so.5.5 =&gt; /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcublas.so.5.5 Mac In a shared library on Mac OS X, there is a field called the install name that indicates the expected installation path and filename the library; the CUDA libraries also use this filename to indicate binary compatibility. The value of this field is propagated into an application built against the library and is used to locate the library of the correct version at runtime. For example, if the install name of the cuBLAS library is given as @rpath/libcublas.5.5.dylib , then the library is version 5.5 and the copy of this library redistributed with the application must be named libcublas.5.5.dylib , even though only -lcublas (with no version number specified) is used at link time. Furthermore, this file should be installed into the @rpath of the application; see Where to Install Redistributed CUDA Libraries . To view a library\u2019s install name, use the otool -L command: $ otool -L a.out a.out: @rpath/libcublas.5.5.dylib (...) Windows The binary compatibility version of the CUDA libraries on Windows is indicated as part of the filename. For example, a 64-bit application linked to cuBLAS 5.5 will look for cublas64_55.dll at runtime, so this is the file that should be redistributed with that application, even though cublas.lib is the file that the application is linked against. For 32-bit applications, the file would be cublas32_55.dll . To verify the exact DLL filename that the application expects to find at runtime, use the dumpbin tool from the Visual Studio command prompt: $ dumpbin /IMPORTS a.exe Microsoft (R) COFF/PE Dumper Version 10.00.40219.01 Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

Because the data is not cached on the GPU, mapped pinned memory should be read or written only once, and the global loads and stores that read and write the memory should be coalesced.
