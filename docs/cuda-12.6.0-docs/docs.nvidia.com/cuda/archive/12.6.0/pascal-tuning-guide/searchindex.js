Developers coming from Kepler, where shared memory atomics were implemented in software using a lock/update/unlock sequence, should see a large performance improvement particularly for heavily contended shared-memory atomics. Pascal also extends atomic addition in global memory to function on FP64 data. The atomicAdd() function in CUDA has thus been generalized to support 32 and 64-bit integer and floating-point types. The rounding mode for all floating-point atomic operations is round-to-nearest-even in Pascal. As in previous generations FP32 atomicAdd() flushes denormalized values to zero. For GP100 atomic operations may target the memories of peer GPUs connected through NVLink. Peer-to-peer atomics over NVLink use the same API as atomics targeting global memory. GPUs connected via PCIE do not support this feature. Pascal GPUs provide support system-wide atomic operations targeting migratable allocations  5 If system-wide atomic visibility is desired, operations targeting migratable memory must specify a system scope by using the atomic[Op]_system() intrinsics 6 . Using the device-scope atomics (e.g. atomicAdd() ) on migratable memory remains valid, but enforces atomic visibility only within the local GPU. Given the potential for incorrect usage of atomic scopes, it is recommended that applications use compute-sanitizer to detect and eliminate errors. As implemented for Pascal, system-wide atomics are intended to allow developers to experiment with enhanced memory models. They are implemented in software and some care is required to achieve good performance. When an atomic targets a migratable address backed by a remote memory space, the local processor page-faults so that the kernel can migrate the appropriate memory page to local memory. Then the usual hardware instructions are used to execute the atomic. Since the page is now locally resident, subsequent atomics from the same processor will not result in additional page-faults.

The effective width of the memory bus is then 4096 bits, a significant increase over the 384 bits in GM200. This allows a tremendous boost in peak bandwidth even at reduced memory clocks. Thus, the GP100 equipped Tesla P100 has a peak bandwidth of 732 GB/s with a modest 715 MHz memory clock. DRAM access latencies remain similar to those observed on Maxwell. In order to hide DRAM latencies at full HBM2 bandwidth, more memory accesses must be kept in flight compared to GPUs equipped with traditional GDDR5.

As with previous architectures, GP104 allows the developer to opt-in to caching all global loads in the unified L1/Texture cache by passing the -Xptxas -dlcm=ca flag to nvcc at compile time. Kepler serviced loads at a granularity of 128B when L1 caching of global loads was enabled and 32B otherwise. On Pascal the data access unit is 32B regardless of whether global loads are cached in L1. So it is no longer necessary to turn off L1 caching in order to reduce wasted global memory transactions associated with uncoalesced accesses. Unlike Maxwell, Pascal caches thread-local memory in the L1 cache. This can mitigate the cost of register spills compared to Maxwell.
