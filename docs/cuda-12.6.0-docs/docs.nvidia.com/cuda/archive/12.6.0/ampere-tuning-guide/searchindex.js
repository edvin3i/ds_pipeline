Therefore, the total number of links available is increased to twelve in A100, versus six in V100, yielding 600 GB/s bidirectional bandwidth versus 300 GB/s for V100. NVLink operates transparently within the existing CUDA model. Transfers between NVLink-connected endpoints are automatically routed through NVLink, rather than PCIe. The cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess() API call remains necessary to enable direct transfers (over either PCIe or NVLink) between GPUs.
