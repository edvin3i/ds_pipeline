With CUDA support in the driver, existing applications (compiled elsewhere on a Linux system for the same target GPU) can run unmodified within the WSL environment. To compile new CUDA applications, a CUDA Toolkit for Linux x86 is needed. CUDA Toolkit support for WSL is still in preview stage as developer tools such as profilers are not available yet. However, CUDA application development is fully supported in the WSL2 environment, as a result, users should be able to compile new CUDA Linux applications with the latest CUDA Toolkit for x86 Linux. Once a Windows NVIDIA GPU driver is installed on the system, CUDA becomes available within WSL 2. The CUDA driver installed on Windows host will be stubbed inside the WSL 2 as libcuda.so , therefore users must not install any NVIDIA GPU Linux driver within WSL 2 . One has to be very careful here as the default CUDA Toolkit comes packaged with a driver, and it is easy to overwrite the WSL 2 NVIDIA driver with the default installation. We recommend developers to use a separate CUDA Toolkit for WSL 2 (Ubuntu) available from the CUDA Toolkit Downloads page to avoid this overwriting. This WSL-Ubuntu CUDA toolkit installer will not overwrite the NVIDIA driver that was already mapped into the WSL 2 environment. To learn how to compile CUDA applications, please read the CUDA documentation for Linux. First, remove the old GPG key: sudo apt-key del 7fa2af80 Option 1: Installation of Linux x86 CUDA Toolkit using WSL-Ubuntu Package - Recommended The CUDA WSL-Ubuntu local installer does not contain the NVIDIA Linux GPU driver, so by following the steps on the CUDA download page for WSL-Ubuntu , you will be able to get just the CUDA toolkit installed on WSL. Option 2: Installation of Linux x86 CUDA Toolkit using Meta Package If you installed the toolkit using the WSL-Ubuntu package, please skip this section. Meta packages do not contain the driver, so by following the steps on the download page for Ubuntu , you will be able to get just the CUDA toolkit installed on WSL. The installation instructions for the CUDA Toolkit can be found in the CUDA Toolkit download page for each installer.

WSL or Windows Subsystem for Linux is a Windows feature that enables users to run native Linux applications, containers and command-line tools directly on Windows 11 and later OS builds. CUDA support in this user guide is specifically for WSL 2, which is the second generation of WSL that offers the following benefits Linux applications can run as is in WSL 2. WSL 2 is characteristically a VM with a Linux WSL Kernel in it that provides full compatibility with mainstream Linux kernel allowing support for native Linux applications including popular Linux distros. Faster file system support and that\u2019s more performant. WSL 2 is tightly integrated with the Microsoft Windows operating system, which allows it to run Linux applications alongside and even interop with other Windows desktop and modern store apps. For the rest of this user guide, WSL and WSL 2 may be used interchangeably. Typically, developers working across both Linux and Windows environments have a very disruptive workflow. They either have to: Use different systems for Linux and Windows, or Dual Boot i.e. install Linux and Windows in separate partitions on the same or different hard disks on the system and boot to the OS of choice. In both cases, developers have to stop all the work and then switch the system or reboot. Also this has historically restricted the development of seamless, well integrated tools and software systems across two dominant ecosystems. WSL enables users to have a seamless transition across the two environments without the need for a resource intensive traditional virtual machine and to improve productivity and develop using tools and integrate their workflow. More importantly WSL 2 enables applications that were hitherto only available on Linux to be available on Windows. WSL 2 support for GPU allows for these applications to benefit from GPU accelerated computing and expands the domain of applications that can be developed on WSL 2. With NVIDIA CUDA support for WSL 2, developers can leverage NVIDIA GPU accelerated computing technology for data science, machine learning and inference on Windows through WSL. GPU acceleration also serves to bring down the performance overhead of running an application inside a WSL like environment close to near-native by being able to pipeline more parallel work on the GPU with less CPU intervention. NVIDIA driver support for WSL 2 includes not only CUDA but also DirectX and Direct ML support. For some helpful examples, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/gpu-tensorflow-wsl . WSL 2 is a key enabler in making GPU acceleration to be seamlessly shared between Windows and Linux applications on the same system a reality. This offers flexibility and versatility while also serving to open up GPU accelerated computing by making it more accessible. Figure 1.
