This enables intra-warp synchronization patterns previously unavailable and simplifies code changes when porting CPU code. However, Independent Thread Scheduling can also lead to a rather different set of threads participating in the executed code than intended if the developer made assumptions about warp-synchronicity 2 of previous hardware architectures. When porting existing codes to Volta or Turing, the following three code patterns need careful attention. For more details see the CUDA C++ Programming Guide . To avoid data corruption, applications using warp intrinsics ( __shfl* , __any , __all , and __ballot ) should transition to the new, safe, synchronizing counterparts, with the *_sync suffix. The new warp intrinsics take in a mask of threads that explicitly define which lanes (threads of a warp) must participate in the warp intrinsic. Applications that assume reads and writes are implicitly visible to other threads in the same warp need to insert the new __syncwarp() warp-wide barrier synchronization instruction between steps where data is exchanged between threads via global or shared memory. Assumptions that code is executed in lockstep or that reads/writes from separate threads are visible across a warp without synchronization are invalid. Applications using __syncthreads() or the PTX bar.sync (and their derivatives) in such a way that a barrier will not be reached by some non-exited thread in the thread block must be modified to ensure that all non-exited threads reach the barrier. The racecheck and synccheck tools provided by compute-sanitizer can help with locating violations.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 4, "doc_id": 15, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#instruction-scheduling", "display_name": "Instruction Scheduling", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "instruction-scheduling", "priority": -1, "content": "Each Turing SM includes 4 warp-scheduler units.

Turing adds acceleration for integer matrix multiply operations. The tensor cores are exposed as Warp-Level Matrix Operations in the CUDA 10 C++ API. The API provides specialized matrix load, matrix multiply and accumulate, and matrix store operations, where each warp processes a small matrix fragment, allowing to efficiently use Tensor Cores from a CUDA-C++ program. In practice, Tensor Cores are used to perform much larger 2D or higher dimensional matrix operations, built up from these smaller matrix fragments. Each Tensor Core performs the matrix multiply-accumulate: D = A x B + C. The Tensor Cores support half precision matrix multiplication, where the matrix multiply inputs A and B are FP16 matrices, while the accumulation matrices C and D may be either FP16 or FP32 matrices. When accumulating in FP32, the FP16 multiply results in a full precision product that is then accumulated using FP32 addition. CUDA 10 supports several fragment sizes, 16x16x16, 32x8x16, and 8x32x16 to use the Tensor Cores on Volta or Turing with FP16 inputs. Any binary compiled for Volta will run on Turing, but Volta binaries using Tensor Cores will only be able to reach half of Turing\u2019s Tensor Core peak performance. Recompiling the binary specifically for Turing would allow it to reach the peak performance. See the Turing Compatibility Guide for more information. Turing\u2019s Tensor Core supports integer matrix multiply operations, which can operate on 8-bit, 4-bit and 1-bit integer inputs, with 32-bit integer accumulation. When operating on 8-bit inputs, CUDA exposes fragment sizes of 16x16x16, 32x8x16, and 8x32x16.

The total size of the unified L1 / Shared Memory cache in Turing is 96 KB. The portion of the cache dedicated to shared memory or L1 (known as the carveout ) can be changed at runtime, either automatically by the driver, or manually using the cudaFuncSetAttribute() with the attribute cudaFuncAttributePreferredSharedMemoryCarveout . Turing supports two carveout configurations, either with 64 KB of shared memory and 32 KB of L1, or with 32 KB of shared memory and 64 KB of L1. Turing allows a single thread block to address the full 64 KB of shared memory. To maintain architectural compatibility, static shared memory allocations remain limited to 48 KB, and an explicit opt-in is also required to enable dynamic allocations above this limit. See the CUDA C++ Programming Guide for details. Like Pascal and Volta, Turing combines the functionality of the L1 and texture caches into a unified L1/Texture cache which acts as a coalescing buffer for memory accesses, gathering up the data requested by the threads of a warp prior to delivery of that data to the warp. The state-of-the-art L1 cache in Volta and Turing offers lower latency, higher bandwidth, and higher capacity compared to the earlier architectures. Like Volta, Turing\u2019s L1 can cache write operations (write-through). The result is that for many applications Volta and Turing narrow the performance gap between explicitly managed shared memory and direct access to device memory. Also, the cost of register spills is lowered compared to Pascal, and the balance of occupancy versus spilling should be re-evaluated to ensure best performance.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 15, "doc_id": 15, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "std", "name": "index", "display_name": "Turing Tuning Guide", "type": "doc", "display_type": "Page", "docname": "index", "anchor": "", "priority": -1, "content": "Tuning CUDA Applications for Turing The programming guide to tuning CUDA Applications for GPUs based on the NVIDIA Turing Architecture.", "keywords": []}]};
