When the countdown reaches zero, a cuda::barrier is complete for the current phase. When the last call to bar.arrive() causes the countdown to reach zero, the countdown is automatically and atomically reset. The reset assigns the countdown to the expected arrival count, and moves the cuda::barrier to the next phase. A token object of class cuda::barrier::arrival_token , as returned from token=bar.arrive() , is associated with the current phase of the barrier. A call to bar.wait(std::move(token)) blocks the calling thread while the cuda::barrier is in the current phase, i.e., while the phase associated with the token matches the phase of the cuda::barrier . If the phase is advanced (because the countdown reaches zero) before the call to bar.wait(std::move(token)) then the thread does not block; if the phase is advanced while the thread is blocked in bar.wait(std::move(token)) , the thread is unblocked. It is essential to know when a reset could or could not occur, especially in non-trivial arrive/wait synchronization patterns. A thread\u2019s calls to token=bar.arrive() and bar.wait(std::move(token)) must be sequenced such that token=bar.arrive() occurs during the cuda::barrier \u2019s current phase, and bar.wait(std::move(token)) occurs during the same or next phase. A thread\u2019s call to bar.arrive() must occur when the barrier\u2019s counter is non-zero. After barrier initialization, if a thread\u2019s call to bar.arrive() causes the countdown to reach zero then a call to bar.wait(std::move(token)) must happen before the barrier can be reused for a subsequent call to bar.arrive() . bar.wait() must only be called using a token object of the current phase or the immediately preceding phase. For any other values of the token object, the behavior is undefined. For simple arrive/wait synchronization patterns, compliance with these usage rules is straightforward.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 2, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#a-scalable-programming-model", "display_name": "A Scalable Programming Model", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "a-scalable-programming-model", "priority": -1, "content": "The advent of multicore CPUs and manycore GPUs means that mainstream processor chips are now parallel systems. The challenge is to develop application software that transparently scales its parallelism to leverage the increasing number of processor cores, much as 3D graphics applications transparently scale their parallelism to manycore GPUs with widely varying numbers of cores. The CUDA parallel programming model is designed to overcome this challenge while maintaining a low learning curve for programmers familiar with standard programming languages such as C. At its core are three key abstractions \u2014 a hierarchy of thread groups, shared memories, and barrier synchronization \u2014 that are simply exposed to the programmer as a minimal set of language extensions. These abstractions provide fine-grained data parallelism and thread parallelism, nested within coarse-grained data parallelism and task parallelism. They guide the programmer to partition the problem into coarse sub-problems that can be solved independently in parallel by blocks of threads, and each sub-problem into finer pieces that can be solved cooperatively in parallel by all threads within the block. This decomposition preserves language expressivity by allowing threads to cooperate when solving each sub-problem, and at the same time enables automatic scalability. Indeed, each block of threads can be scheduled on any of the available multiprocessors within a GPU, in any order, concurrently or sequentially, so that a compiled CUDA program can execute on any number of multiprocessors as illustrated by Figure 3 , and only the runtime system needs to know the physical multiprocessor count. This scalable programming model allows the GPU architecture to span a wide market range by simply scaling the number of multiprocessors and memory partitions: from the high-performance enthusiast GeForce GPUs and professional Quadro and Tesla computing products to a variety of inexpensive, mainstream GeForce GPUs (see CUDA-Enabled GPUs for a list of all CUDA-enabled GPUs). Automatic Scalability A GPU is built around an array of Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) (see Hardware Implementation for more details). A multithreaded program is partitioned into blocks of threads that execute independently from each other, so that a GPU with more multiprocessors will automatically execute the program in less time than a GPU with fewer multiprocessors.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 3, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#access-new-cuda-features", "display_name": "Access new CUDA features", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "access-new-cuda-features", "priority": -1, "content": "It is always recommended to install the latest CUDA toolkit to access new CUDA driver features, but if for some reason, a user does not want to update or does not have access to the latest toolkit, the API can be used to access new CUDA features with only an updated CUDA driver.

When a graph does not free an allocation, that allocation persists beyond the execution of the graph and can be accessed by subsequent CUDA operations. These allocations may be accessed in another graph or directly using a stream operation as long as the accessing operation is ordered after the allocation through CUDA events and other stream ordering mechanisms. An allocation may subsequently be freed by regular calls to cudaFree , cudaFreeAsync , or by the launch of another graph with a corresponding free node, or a subsequent launch of the allocating graph (if it was instantiated with the cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch flag). It is illegal to access memory after it has been freed - the free operation must be ordered after all operations accessing the memory using graph dependencies, CUDA events, and other stream ordering mechanisms. Because graph allocations may share underlying physical memory with each other, the Virtual Aliasing Support rules relating to consistency and coherency must be considered. Simply put, the free operation must be ordered after the full device operation (for example, compute kernel / memcpy) completes. Specifically, out of band synchronization - for example a handshake through memory as part of a compute kernel that accesses the graph-allocated memory - is not sufficient for providing ordering guarantees between the memory writes to graph memory and the free operation of that graph memory. The following code snippets demonstrate accessing graph allocations outside of the allocating graph with ordering properly established by: using a single stream, using events between streams, and using events baked into the allocating and freeing graph. Ordering established by using a single stream: void *dptr; cudaGraphAddMemAllocNode(&amp;allocNode, allocGraph, NULL, 0, &amp;params); dptr = params.dptr; cudaGraphInstantiate(&amp;allocGraphExec, allocGraph, NULL, NULL, 0); cudaGraphLaunch(allocGraphExec, stream); kernel&lt;&lt;&lt; \u2026, stream &gt;&gt;&gt;(dptr, \u2026); cudaFreeAsync(dptr, stream); Ordering established by recording and waiting on CUDA events: void *dptr; // Contents of allocating graph cudaGraphAddMemAllocNode(&amp;allocNode, allocGraph, NULL, 0, &amp;params); dptr = params.dptr; // contents of consuming/freeing graph nodeParams-&gt;kernelParams[0] = params.dptr; cudaGraphAddKernelNode(&amp;a, graph, NULL, 0, &amp;nodeParams); cudaGraphAddMemFreeNode(&amp;freeNode, freeGraph, &amp;a, 1, dptr); cudaGraphInstantiate(&amp;allocGraphExec, allocGraph, NULL, NULL, 0); cudaGraphInstantiate(&amp;freeGraphExec, freeGraph, NULL, NULL, 0); cudaGraphLaunch(allocGraphExec, allocStream); // establish the dependency of stream2 on the allocation node // note: the dependency could also have been established with a stream synchronize operation cudaEventRecord(allocEvent, allocStream) cudaStreamWaitEvent(stream2, allocEvent); kernel&lt;&lt;&lt; \u2026, stream2 &gt;&gt;&gt; (dptr, \u2026); // establish the dependency between the stream 3 and the allocation use cudaStreamRecordEvent(streamUseDoneEvent, stream2); cudaStreamWaitEvent(stream3, streamUseDoneEvent); // it is now safe to launch the freeing graph, which may also access the memory cudaGraphLaunch(freeGraphExec, stream3); Ordering established by using graph external event nodes: void *dptr; cudaEvent_t allocEvent; // event indicating when the allocation will be ready for use. cudaEvent_t streamUseDoneEvent; // event indicating when the stream operations are done with the allocation. // Contents of allocating graph with event record node cudaGraphAddMemAllocNode(&amp;allocNode, allocGraph, NULL, 0, &amp;params); dptr = params.dptr; // note: this event record node depends on the alloc node cudaGraphAddEventRecordNode(&amp;recordNode, allocGraph, &amp;allocNode, 1, allocEvent); cudaGraphInstantiate(&amp;allocGraphExec, allocGraph, NULL, NULL, 0); // contents of consuming/freeing graph with event wait nodes cudaGraphAddEventWaitNode(&amp;streamUseDoneEventNode, waitAndFreeGraph, NULL, 0, streamUseDoneEvent); cudaGraphAddEventWaitNode(&amp;allocReadyEventNode, waitAndFreeGraph, NULL, 0, allocEvent); nodeParams-&gt;kernelParams[0] = params.dptr; // The allocReadyEventNode provides ordering with the alloc node for use in a consuming graph. cudaGraphAddKernelNode(&amp;kernelNode, waitAndFreeGraph, &amp;allocReadyEventNode, 1, &amp;nodeParams); // The free node has to be ordered after both external and internal users. // Thus the node must depend on both the kernelNode and the // streamUseDoneEventNode. dependencies[0] = kernelNode; dependencies[1] = streamUseDoneEventNode; cudaGraphAddMemFreeNode(&amp;freeNode, waitAndFreeGraph, &amp;dependencies, 2, dptr); cudaGraphInstantiate(&amp;waitAndFreeGraphExec, waitAndFreeGraph, NULL, NULL, 0); cudaGraphLaunch(allocGraphExec, allocStream); // establish the dependency of stream2 on the event node satisfies the ordering requirement cudaStreamWaitEvent(stream2, allocEvent); kernel&lt;&lt;&lt; \u2026, stream2 &gt;&gt;&gt; (dptr, \u2026); cudaStreamRecordEvent(streamUseDoneEvent, stream2); // the event wait node in the waitAndFreeGraphExec establishes the dependency on the \u201creadyForFreeEvent\u201d that is needed to prevent the kernel running in stream two from accessing the allocation after the free node in execution order. cudaGraphLaunch(waitAndFreeGraphExec, stream3);", "keywords": []}, {"id": 5, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#additional-notes", "display_name": "Additional Notes", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "additional-notes", "priority": -1, "content": "ADL Lookup : As described earlier, the CUDA compiler will replace an extended lambda expression with an instance of a placeholder type, before invoking the host compiler.

The usage in user code compiled against CUDA 11.5 is: #include &lt;cuda.h&gt; #include &lt;cudaTypedefs.h&gt; CUresult status; int cudaVersion; CUdriverProcAddressQueryResult driverStatus; status = cuDriverGetVersion(&amp;cudaVersion); // handle status PFN_cuFoo_v11040 pfn_cuFoo_v11040; PFN_cuFoo_v11050 pfn_cuFoo_v11050; if(cudaVersion &lt; 11050 ) { // We know to get the CUDA 11.4 version status = cuGetProcAddress(&quot;cuFoo&quot;, &amp;pfn_cuFoo_v11040, cudaVersion, CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_DEFAULT, &amp;driverStatus); // Handle status and validating pfn_cuFoo_v11040 } else { // Assume &gt;= CUDA 11.5 version we can use the second version status = cuGetProcAddress(&quot;cuFoo&quot;, &amp;pfn_cuFoo_v11050, cudaVersion, CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_DEFAULT, &amp;driverStatus); // Handle status and validating pfn_cuFoo_v11050 } In this example, without updates for the new typedef in CUDA 11.6 and recompiling the application with those new typedefs and case handling, the application will get the cuFoo_v3 function pointer returned and any usage of that function would then cause undefined behavior. The point of this example was to illustrate that even explicit version checks for cuGetProcAddress may not safely cover the minor version bumps within a CUDA major release.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 27, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#application-compatibility", "display_name": "Application Compatibility", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "application-compatibility", "priority": -1, "content": "To execute code on devices of specific compute capability, an application must load binary or PTX code that is compatible with this compute capability as described in Binary Compatibility and PTX Compatibility . In particular, to be able to execute code on future architectures with higher compute capability (for which no binary code can be generated yet), an application must load PTX code that will be just-in-time compiled for these devices (see Just-in-Time Compilation ). Which PTX and binary code gets embedded in a CUDA C++ application is controlled by the -arch and -code compiler options or the -gencode compiler option as detailed in the nvcc user manual. For example, nvcc x.cu -gencode arch=compute_50,code=sm_50 -gencode arch=compute_60,code=sm_60 -gencode arch=compute_70,code=\\&quot;compute_70,sm_70\\&quot; embeds binary code compatible with compute capability 5.0 and 6.0 (first and second -gencode options) and PTX and binary code compatible with compute capability 7.0 (third -gencode option). Host code is generated to automatically select at runtime the most appropriate code to load and execute, which, in the above example, will be: 5.0 binary code for devices with compute capability 5.0 and 5.2, 6.0 binary code for devices with compute capability 6.0 and 6.1, 7.0 binary code for devices with compute capability 7.0 and 7.5, PTX code which is compiled to binary code at runtime for devices with compute capability 8.0 and 8.6. x.cu can have an optimized code path that uses warp reduction operations, for example, which are only supported in devices of compute capability 8.0 and higher. The __CUDA_ARCH__ macro can be used to differentiate various code paths based on compute capability. It is only defined for device code. When compiling with -arch=compute_80 for example, __CUDA_ARCH__ is equal to 800 . If x.cu is compiled for architecture conditional features example with sm_90a or compute_90a , the code can only run on devices with compute capability 9.0. Applications using the driver API must compile code to separate files and explicitly load and execute the most appropriate file at runtime. The Volta architecture introduces Independent Thread Scheduling which changes the way threads are scheduled on the GPU. For code relying on specific behavior of SIMT scheduling in previous architectures, Independent Thread Scheduling may alter the set of participating threads, leading to incorrect results. To aid migration while implementing the corrective actions detailed in Independent Thread Scheduling , Volta developers can opt-in to Pascal\u2019s thread scheduling with the compiler option combination -arch=compute_60 -code=sm_70 . The nvcc user manual lists various shorthands for the -arch , -code , and -gencode compiler options. For example, -arch=sm_70 is a shorthand for -arch=compute_70 -code=compute_70,sm_70 (which is the same as -gencode arch=compute_70,code=\\&quot;compute_70,sm_70\\&quot; ).", "keywords": []}, {"id": 28, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#application-level", "display_name": "Application Level", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "application-level", "priority": -1, "content": "At a high level, the application should maximize parallel execution between the host, the devices, and the bus connecting the host to the devices, by using asynchronous functions calls and streams as described in Asynchronous Concurrent Execution .

For the parallel workloads, at points in the algorithm where parallelism is broken because some threads need to synchronize in order to share data with each other, there are two cases: Either these threads belong to the same block, in which case they should use __syncthreads() and share data through shared memory within the same kernel invocation, or they belong to different blocks, in which case they must share data through global memory using two separate kernel invocations, one for writing to and one for reading from global memory. The second case is much less optimal since it adds the overhead of extra kernel invocations and global memory traffic.

The implementation may be different for devices of different compute capabilities, and the number of native instructions after compilation may fluctuate with every compiler version. For complicated functions, there can be multiple code paths depending on input. cuobjdump can be used to inspect a particular implementation in a cubin object. The implementation of some functions are readily available on the CUDA header files ( math_functions.h , device_functions.h , \u2026). In general, code compiled with -ftz=true (denormalized numbers are flushed to zero) tends to have higher performance than code compiled with -ftz=false . Similarly, code compiled with -prec-div=false (less precise division) tends to have higher performance code than code compiled with -prec-div=true , and code compiled with -prec-sqrt=false (less precise square root) tends to have higher performance than code compiled with -prec-sqrt=true . The nvcc user manual describes these compilation flags in more details. Single-Precision Floating-Point Division __fdividef(x, y) (see Intrinsic Functions ) provides faster single-precision floating-point division than the division operator. Single-Precision Floating-Point Reciprocal Square Root To preserve IEEE-754 semantics the compiler can optimize 1.0/sqrtf() into rsqrtf() only when both reciprocal and square root are approximate, (i.e., with -prec-div=false and -prec-sqrt=false ). It is therefore recommended to invoke rsqrtf() directly where desired. Single-Precision Floating-Point Square Root Single-precision floating-point square root is implemented as a reciprocal square root followed by a reciprocal instead of a reciprocal square root followed by a multiplication so that it gives correct results for 0 and infinity. Sine and Cosine sinf(x) , cosf(x) , tanf(x) , sincosf(x) , and corresponding double-precision instructions are much more expensive and even more so if the argument x is large in magnitude. More precisely, the argument reduction code (see Mathematical Functions for implementation) comprises two code paths referred to as the fast path and the slow path, respectively. The fast path is used for arguments sufficiently small in magnitude and essentially consists of a few multiply-add operations. The slow path is used for arguments large in magnitude and consists of lengthy computations required to achieve correct results over the entire argument range. At present, the argument reduction code for the trigonometric functions selects the fast path for arguments whose magnitude is less than 105615.0f for the single-precision functions, and less than 2147483648.0 for the double-precision functions. As the slow path requires more registers than the fast path, an attempt has been made to reduce register pressure in the slow path by storing some intermediate variables in local memory, which may affect performance because of local memory high latency and bandwidth (see Device Memory Accesses ). At present, 28 bytes of local memory are used by single-precision functions, and 44 bytes are used by double-precision functions. However, the exact amount is subject to change. Due to the lengthy computations and use of local memory in the slow path, the throughput of these trigonometric functions is lower by one order of magnitude when the slow path reduction is required as opposed to the fast path reduction. Integer Arithmetic Integer division and modulo operation are costly as they compile to up to 20 instructions. They can be replaced with bitwise operations in some cases: If n is a power of 2, ( i/n ) is equivalent to (i&gt;&gt;log2(n)) and (i%n) is equivalent to ( i&amp;(n-1) ); the compiler will perform these conversions if n is literal. __brev and __popc map to a single instruction and __brevll and __popcll to a few instructions. __[u]mul24 are legacy intrinsic functions that no longer have any reason to be used. Half Precision Arithmetic In order to achieve good performance for 16-bit precision floating-point add, multiply or multiply-add, it is recommended that the half2 datatype is used for half precision and __nv_bfloat162 be used for __nv_bfloat16 precision. Vector intrinsics (for example, __hadd2 , __hsub2 , __hmul2 , __hfma2 ) can then be used to do two operations in a single instruction. Using half2 or __nv_bfloat162 in place of two calls using half or __nv_bfloat16 may also help performance of other intrinsics, such as warp shuffles. The intrinsic __halves2half2 is provided to convert two half precision values to the half2 datatype. The intrinsic __halves2bfloat162 is provided to convert two __nv_bfloat precision values to the __nv_bfloat162 datatype. Type Conversion Sometimes, the compiler must insert conversion instructions, introducing additional execution cycles. This is the case for: Functions operating on variables of type char or short whose operands generally need to be converted to int , Double-precision floating-point constants (i.e., those constants defined without any type suffix) used as input to single-precision floating-point computations (as mandated by C/C++ standards). This last case can be avoided by using single-precision floating-point constants, defined with an f suffix such as 3.141592653589793f , 1.0f , 0.5f .", "keywords": []}, {"id": 35, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#arrive-on-barrier-primitive", "display_name": "Arrive On Barrier Primitive", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "arrive-on-barrier-primitive", "priority": -1, "content": "void __pipeline_arrive_on(__mbarrier_t* bar); bar points to a barrier in shared memory.

Often, the data is laid out in global memory as a multi-dimensional array with non-sequential data acess patterns. To reduce global memory usage, sub-tiles of such arrays are copied to shared memory before use in computations. The loading and storing involves address-calculations that can be error-prone and repetitive. To offload these computations, Compute Capability 9.0 introduces the Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA). The primary goal of TMA is to provide an efficient data transfer mechanism from global memory to shared memory for multi-dimensional arrays. Naming . Tensor memory accelerator (TMA) is a broad term used to market the features described in this section. For the purpose of forward-compatibility and to reduce discrepancies with the PTX ISA, the text in this section refers to TMA operations as either bulk-asynchronous copies or bulk tensor asynchronous copies, depending on the specific type of copy used. The term \u201cbulk\u201d is used to contrast these operations with the asynchronous memory operations described in the previous sections. Dimensions . TMA supports copying both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays (up to 5-dimensional). The programming model for bulk-asynchronous copies of one-dimensional contiguous arrays is different from the programming model for bulk tensor asynchronous copies of multi-dimensional arrays. To perform a bulk tensor asynchronous copy of a multi-dimensional array, the hardware requires a tensor map . This object describes the layout of the multi-dimensional array in global and shared memory. A tensor map is typically created on the host using the cuTensorMapEncode API and then transferred from host to device as a const kernel parameter annotated with __grid_constant__ . The tensor map is transferred from host to device as a const kernel parameter annotated with __grid_constant__ , and can be used on the device to copy a tile of data between shared and global memory. In contrast, performing a bulk-asynchronous copy of a contiguous one-dimensional array does not require a tensor map: it can be performed on-device with a pointer and size parameter. Source and destination . The source and destination addresses of bulk-asynchronous copy operations can be in shared or global memory. The operations can read data from global to shared memory, write data from shared to global memory, and also copy from shared memory to Distributed Shared Memory of another block in the same cluster. In addition, when in a cluster, a bulk-asynchronous operation can be specified as being multicast. In this case, data can be transferred from global memory to the shared memory of multiple blocks within the cluster. The multicast feature is optimized for target architecture sm_90a and may have significantly reduced performance on other targets. Hence, it is advised to be used with compute architecture  sm_90a . Asynchronous . Data transfers using TMA are asynchronous . This allows the initiating thread to continue computing while the hardware asynchronously copies the data. Whether the data transfer occurs asynchronously in practice is up to the hardware implementation and may change in the future . There are several completion mechanisms that bulk-asynchronous operations can use to signal that they have completed. When the operation reads from global to shared memory, any thread in the block can wait for the data to be readable in shared memory by waiting on a Shared Memory Barrier . When the bulk-asynchronous operation writes data from shared memory to global or distributed shared memory, only the initiating thread can wait for the operation to have completed. This is accomplished using a bulk async-group based completion mechanism. A table describing the completion mechanisms can be found below and in the PTX ISA . Direction Completion mechanism Destination Source Asychronous copy Bulk-asynchronous copy (TMA) Global Global Global Shared::cta Bulk async-group Shared::cta Global Async-group, mbarrier Mbarrier Shared::cluster Global Mbarrier (multicast) Shared::cta Shared::cluster Mbarrier Shared::cta Shared::cta", "keywords": []}, {"id": 46, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#asynchronous-operations", "display_name": "Asynchronous Operations", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "asynchronous-operations", "priority": -1, "content": "An asynchronous operation is defined as an operation that is initiated by a CUDA thread and is executed asynchronously as-if by another thread. In a well formed program one or more CUDA threads synchronize with the asynchronous operation. The CUDA thread that initiated the asynchronous operation is not required to be among the synchronizing threads. Such an asynchronous thread (an as-if thread) is always associated with the CUDA thread that initiated the asynchronous operation. An asynchronous operation uses a synchronization object to synchronize the completion of the operation. Such a synchronization object can be explicitly managed by a user (e.g., cuda::memcpy_async ) or implicitly managed within a library (e.g., cooperative_groups::memcpy_async ). A synchronization object could be a cuda::barrier or a cuda::pipeline . These objects are explained in detail in Asynchronous Barrier and Asynchronous Data Copies using cuda::pipeline .

When barrier_arrive is called with a group, result of calling any collective operation or another barrier arrival with that group is undefined until completion of the barrier phase is observed with barrier_wait call. Threads blocked on barrier_wait might be released from the synchronization before other threads call barrier_wait , but only after all threads in the group called barrier_arrive .

Initialization must happen before any thread calls bar.arrive() . This poses a bootstrapping challenge in that threads must synchronize before participating in the cuda::barrier , but threads are creating a cuda::barrier in order to synchronize. In this example, threads that will participate are part of a cooperative group and use block.sync() to bootstrap initialization. In this example a whole thread block is participating in initialization, hence __syncthreads() could also be used.

In addition, the supported language is extended with CUDA-specific constructs described in this document 13 , and is subject to the restrictions described below. C++11 Language Features , C++14 Language Features and C++17 Language Features provide support matrices for the C++11, C++14, C++17 and C++20 features, respectively. Restrictions lists the language restrictions. Polymorphic Function Wrappers and Extended Lambdas describe additional features.

Additionally, memory migration is generally more expensive with larger page sizes compared to smaller page sizes, because we typically migrate full memory pages. This can cause larger latency spikes in an application using large page sizes. See also the next section for more details on page faults. One important aspect for performance tuning is that TLB misses are generally significantly more expensive on the GPU compared to the CPU. This means that if a GPU thread frequently accesses random locations of Unified Memory mapped using a small enough page size, it might be significantly slower compared to the same accesses to Unified Memory mapped using a large enough page size. While a similar effect might occur for a CPU thread randomly accessing a large area of memory mapped using a small page size, the slowdown is less pronounced, meaning that the application might want to trade-off this slowdown with having less memory fragmentation.

Example: #include &lt;cudaTypedefs.h&gt; CUuuid uuid; CUdevice dev; CUresult status; int cudaVersion; CUdriverProcAddressQueryResult driverStatus; status = cuDeviceGet(&amp;dev, 0); // Get device 0 // handle status status = cuDriverGetVersion(&amp;cudaVersion); // handle status PFN_cuDeviceGetUuid pfn_cuDeviceGetUuid; status = cuGetProcAddress(&quot;cuDeviceGetUuid&quot;, &amp;pfn_cuDeviceGetUuid, cudaVersion, CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_DEFAULT, &amp;driverStatus); if(CUDA_SUCCESS == status &amp;&amp; pfn_cuDeviceGetUuid) { // pfn_cuDeviceGetUuid points to ??? } In this example, assume the user is compiling with CUDA 11.3.

Since CUDA has guaranteed ABI compatibility between minor versions, this same application is expected to run after the driver is upgraded to CUDA 11.4 (without updating the toolkit and runtime) without requiring recompilation. This will have undefined behavior though, because now the typedef for PFN_cuDeviceGetUuid will still be of the signature for the original version, but since cudaVersion would now be 11040 (CUDA 11.4), cuGetProcAddress would return the function pointer to the _v2 version, meaning calling it might have undefined behavior.

The Tesla and Fermi architectures are no longer supported starting with CUDA 7.0 and CUDA 9.0, respectively.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 113, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#compute-modes", "display_name": "Compute Modes", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "compute-modes", "priority": -1, "content": "On Tesla solutions running Windows Server 2008 and later or Linux, one can set any device in a system in one of the three following modes using NVIDIA\u2019s System Management Interface (nvidia-smi), which is a tool distributed as part of the driver: Default compute mode: Multiple host threads can use the device (by calling cudaSetDevice() on this device, when using the runtime API, or by making current a context associated to the device, when using the driver API) at the same time. Exclusive-process compute mode: Only one CUDA context may be created on the device across all processes in the system. The context may be current to as many threads as desired within the process that created that context. Prohibited compute mode: No CUDA context can be created on the device. This means, in particular, that a host thread using the runtime API without explicitly calling cudaSetDevice() might be associated with a device other than device 0 if device 0 turns out to be in prohibited mode or in exclusive-process mode and used by another process. cudaSetValidDevices() can be used to set a device from a prioritized list of devices. Note also that, for devices featuring the Pascal architecture onwards (compute capability with major revision number 6 and higher), there exists support for Compute Preemption. This allows compute tasks to be preempted at instruction-level granularity, rather than thread block granularity as in prior Maxwell and Kepler GPU architecture, with the benefit that applications with long-running kernels can be prevented from either monopolizing the system or timing out. However, there will be context switch overheads associated with Compute Preemption, which is automatically enabled on those devices for which support exists. The individual attribute query function cudaDeviceGetAttribute() with the attribute cudaDevAttrComputePreemptionSupported can be used to determine if the device in use supports Compute Preemption.

All resources and actions performed within the driver API are encapsulated inside a CUDA context, and the system automatically cleans up these resources when the context is destroyed. Besides objects such as modules and texture or surface references, each context has its own distinct address space. As a result, CUdeviceptr values from different contexts reference different memory locations. A host thread may have only one device context current at a time. When a context is created with cuCtxCreate( ), it is made current to the calling host thread. CUDA functions that operate in a context (most functions that do not involve device enumeration or context management) will return CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT if a valid context is not current to the thread. Each host thread has a stack of current contexts. cuCtxCreate() pushes the new context onto the top of the stack. cuCtxPopCurrent() may be called to detach the context from the host thread. The context is then \u201cfloating\u201d and may be pushed as the current context for any host thread. cuCtxPopCurrent() also restores the previous current context, if any. A usage count is also maintained for each context. cuCtxCreate() creates a context with a usage count of 1. cuCtxAttach() increments the usage count and cuCtxDetach() decrements it. A context is destroyed when the usage count goes to 0 when calling cuCtxDetach() or cuCtxDestroy() . The driver API is interoperable with the runtime and it is possible to access the primary context (see Initialization ) managed by the runtime from the driver API via cuDevicePrimaryCtxRetain() . Usage count facilitates interoperability between third party authored code operating in the same context. For example, if three libraries are loaded to use the same context, each library would call cuCtxAttach() to increment the usage count and cuCtxDetach() to decrement the usage count when the library is done using the context. For most libraries, it is expected that the application will have created a context before loading or initializing the library; that way, the application can create the context using its own heuristics, and the library simply operates on the context handed to it.

To obtain best performance in cases where the control flow depends on the thread ID, the controlling condition should be written so as to minimize the number of divergent warps. This is possible because the distribution of the warps across the block is deterministic as mentioned in SIMT Architecture . A trivial example is when the controlling condition only depends on ( threadIdx / warpSize ) where warpSize is the warp size. In this case, no warp diverges since the controlling condition is perfectly aligned with the warps. Sometimes, the compiler may unroll loops or it may optimize out short if or switch blocks by using branch predication instead, as detailed below. In these cases, no warp can ever diverge. The programmer can also control loop unrolling using the #pragma unroll directive (see #pragma unroll ). When using branch predication none of the instructions whose execution depends on the controlling condition gets skipped. Instead, each of them is associated with a per-thread condition code or predicate that is set to true or false based on the controlling condition and although each of these instructions gets scheduled for execution, only the instructions with a true predicate are actually executed. Instructions with a false predicate do not write results, and also do not evaluate addresses or read operands.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 135, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#control-l2-cache-set-aside-size-for-persisting-memory-access", "display_name": "Control L2 Cache Set-Aside Size for Persisting Memory Access", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "control-l2-cache-set-aside-size-for-persisting-memory-access", "priority": -1, "content": "The L2 set-aside cache size for persisting memory accesses is queried using CUDA runtime API cudaDeviceGetLimit and set using CUDA runtime API cudaDeviceSetLimit as a cudaLimit .

Systems with separate page tables for CPUs and GPUs are referred to as software coherent . Hardware coherent systems such as NVIDIA Grace Hopper offer a logically combined page table for both CPUs and GPUs. This is important because in order to access System-Allocated Memory from the GPU , the GPU uses whichever page table entry was created by the CPU for the requested memory. If that page table entry uses the default CPU page size of 4KiB or 64KiB, accesses to large virtual memory areas will cause significant TLB misses, thus significant slowdowns. See the section on configuring huge pages for examples on how to ensure System-Allocated Memory uses large enough page sizes to avoid this type of issue. On the other hand, on systems where the CPUs and GPUs each have their own logical page table, different performance tuning aspects should be considered: in order to guarantee coherency , these systems usually use page faults in case a processor accesses a memory address mapped into the physical memory of a different processor. Such a page fault means that: it needs to be ensured that the currently owning processor (where the physical page currently resides) cannot access this page anymore, either by deleting the page table entry or updating it. it needs to be ensured that the processor requesting access can access this page, either by creating a new page table entry or updating and existing entry, such that it becomes valid/active. the physical page backing this virtual page must be moved/migrated to the processor requesting access: this can be an expensive operation, and the amount of work is proportional to the page size. Overall, hardware coherent systems provide significant performance benefits compared to software coherent systems in cases where frequent concurrent accesses to the same memory page are made by both CPU and GPU threads: less page-faults: these systems do not need to use page-faults for emulating coherency or migrating memory, less contention: these systems are coherent at cache-line granularity instead of page-size granularity, that is, when there is contention from multiple processors within a cache line, only the cache line is exchanged which is much smaller than the smallest page-size, and when the different processors access different cache-lines within a page, then there is no contention.

While allocations may be exported and even imported without synchronizing with the allocating stream in any way, the importing process must follow the same rules as the exporting process when accessing the allocation.

Environment variables related to the Multi-Process Service are documented in the Multi-Process Service section of the GPU Deployment and Management guide. Variable Values Description Device Enumeration and Properties CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES A comma-separated sequence of GPU identifiers MIG support: MIG-&lt;GPU-UUID&gt;/&lt;GPU instance ID&gt;/&lt;compute instance ID&gt; GPU identifiers are given as integer indices or as UUID strings. GPU UUID strings should follow the same format as given by nvidia-smi , such as GPU-8932f937-d72c-4106-c12f-20bd9faed9f6. However, for convenience, abbreviated forms are allowed; simply specify enough digits from the beginning of the GPU UUID to uniquely identify that GPU in the target system. For example, CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=GPU-8932f937 may be a valid way to refer to the above GPU UUID, assuming no other GPU in the system shares this prefix. Only the devices whose index is present in the sequence are visible to CUDA applications and they are enumerated in the order of the sequence. If one of the indices is invalid, only the devices whose index precedes the invalid index are visible to CUDA applications. For example, setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES to 2,1 causes device 0 to be invisible and device 2 to be enumerated before device 1. Setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES to 0,2,-1,1 causes devices 0 and 2 to be visible and device 1 to be invisible. MIG format starts with MIG keyword and GPU UUID should follow the same format as given by nvidia-smi . For example, MIG-GPU-8932f937-d72c-4106-c12f-20bd9faed9f6/1/2. Only single MIG instance enumeration is supported. CUDA_MANAGED_FORCE_DEVICE_ALLOC 0 or 1 (default is 0) Forces the driver to place all managed allocations in device memory. CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER FASTEST_FIRST, PCI_BUS_ID, (default is FASTEST_FIRST) FASTEST_FIRST causes CUDA to enumerate the available devices in fastest to slowest order using a simple heuristic. PCI_BUS_ID orders devices by PCI bus ID in ascending order. Compilation CUDA_CACHE_DISABLE 0 or 1 (default is 0) Disables caching (when set to 1) or enables caching (when set to 0) for just-in-time-compilation. When disabled, no binary code is added to or retrieved from the cache. CUDA_CACHE_PATH filepath Specifies the folder where the just-in-time compiler caches binary codes; the default values are: on Windows, %APPDATA%\\NVIDIA\\ComputeCache on Linux, ~/.nv/ComputeCache CUDA_CACHE_MAXSIZE integer (default is 1073741824 (1 GiB) for desktop/server platforms and 268435456 (256 MiB) for embedded platforms and the maximum is 4294967296 (4 GiB)) Specifies the size in bytes of the cache used by the just-in-time compiler. Binary codes whose size exceeds the cache size are not cached. Older binary codes are evicted from the cache to make room for newer binary codes if needed. CUDA_FORCE_PTX_JIT 0 or 1 (default is 0) When set to 1, forces the device driver to ignore any binary code embedded in an application (see Application Compatibility ) and to just-in-time compile embedded PTX code instead. If a kernel does not have embedded PTX code, it will fail to load. This environment variable can be used to validate that PTX code is embedded in an application and that its just-in-time compilation works as expected to guarantee application forward compatibility with future architectures (see Just-in-Time Compilation ). CUDA_DISABLE_PTX_JIT 0 or 1 (default is 0) When set to 1, disables the just-in-time compilation of embedded PTX code and use the compatible binary code embedded in an application (see Application Compatibility ). If a kernel does not have embedded binary code or the embedded binary was compiled for an incompatible architecture, then it will fail to load. This environment variable can be used to validate that an application has the compatible SASS code generated for each kernel.(see Binary Compatibility ). CUDA_FORCE_JIT 0 or 1 (default is 0) When set to 1, forces the device driver to ignore any binary code embedded in an application (see Application Compatibility ) and to just-in-time compile embedded PTX code instead. If a kernel does not have embedded PTX code, it will fail to load. This environment variable can be used to validate that PTX code is embedded in an application and that its just-in-time compilation works as expected to guarantee application forward compatibility with future architectures (see Just-in-Time Compilation ). The behavior can be overridden for embedded PTX by setting CUDA_FORCE_PTX_JIT=0 . CUDA_DISABLE_JIT 0 or 1 (default is 0) When set to 1, disables the just-in-time compilation of embedded PTX code and use the compatible binary code embedded in an application (see Application Compatibility ). If a kernel does not have embedded binary code or the embedded binary was compiled for an incompatible architecture, then it will fail to load. This environment variable can be used to validate that an application has the compatible SASS code generated for each kernel.(see Binary Compatibility ). The behavior can be overridden for embedded PTX by setting CUDA_DISABLE_PTX_JIT=0 . Execution CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING 0 or 1 (default is 0) Disables (when set to 1) or enables (when set to 0) asynchronous kernel launches. CUDA_DEVICE_MAX_CONNECTIONS 1 to 32 (default is 8) Sets the number of compute and copy engine concurrent connections (work queues) from the host to each device of compute capability 3.5 and above. CUDA_DEVICE_MAX_COPY_CONNECTIONS 1 to 32 (default is 8) Sets the number of copy engine concurrent connections (work queues) per async copy engine from the host to each device of compute capability 8.0 and above. When both CUDA_DEVICE_MAX_CONNECTIONS and CUDA_DEVICE_MAX_COPY_CONNECTIONS are set, only the number of copy connections set by CUDA_DEVICE_MAX_CONNECTIONS will be overwritten. CUDA_AUTO_BOOST 0 or 1 Overrides the autoboost behavior set by the \u2013auto-boost-default option of nvidia-smi. If an application requests via this environment variable a behavior that is different from nvidia-smi\u2019s, its request is honored if there is no other application currently running on the same GPU that successfully requested a different behavior, otherwise it is ignored. CUDA_SCALE_LAUNCH_QUEUES \u201c0.25x\u201d, \u201c0.5x\u201d, \u201c2x\u201d or \u201c4x\u201d Scales the size of the queues available for launching work by a fixed multiplier. cuda-gdb (on Linux platform) CUDA_DEVICE_WAITS_ON_EXCEPTION 0 or 1 (default is 0) When set to 1, a CUDA application will halt when a device exception occurs, allowing a debugger to be attached for further debugging. MPS service (on Linux platform) CUDA_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PERSISTING_L2_CACHE_PERCENTAGE_LIMIT Percentage value (between 0 - 100, default is 0) Devices of compute capability 8.x allow, a portion of L2 cache to be set-aside for persisting data accesses to global memory. When using CUDA MPS service, the set-aside size can only be controlled using this environment variable, before starting CUDA MPS control daemon. I.e., the environment variable should be set before running the command nvidia-cuda-mps-control -d . Module loading CUDA_MODULE_LOADING DEFAULT, LAZY, EAGER (default is LAZY) Specifies the module loading mode for the application. When set to EAGER, all kernels and data from a cubin, fatbin or a PTX file are fully loaded upon corresponding cuModuleLoad* and cuLibraryLoad* API call. When set to LAZY, loading of specific kernels is delayed to the point a CUfunc handle is extracted with cuModuleGetFunction or cuKernelGetFunction API calls and data from the cubin is loaded at load of first kernel in the cubin or at first access of variables in the cubin. Default behavior may change in future CUDA releases. CUDA_MODULE_DATA_LOADING DEFAULT, LAZY, EAGER (default is LAZY) Specifies the data loading mode for the application. When set to EAGER, all data from a cubin, fatbin or a PTX file are fully loaded to memory upon corresponding cuLibraryLoad* . This doesn\u2019t affect the LAZY or EAGER loading of kernels. When set to LAZY, loading of data is delayed to the point at which a handle is required. Default behavior may change in future CUDA releases. Data loading behavior is inherited from CUDA_MODULE_LOADING if this environment variable is not set. Pre-loading dependent libraries CUDA_FORCE_PRELOAD_LIBRARIES 0 or 1 (default is 0) When set to 1, forces the driver to preload the libraries required for NVVM and PTX just-in-time compilation during driver initialization. This will increase the memory footprint and the time taken for CUDA driver initialization. This environment variable needs to be set to avoid certain deadlock situations involving multiple CUDA threads. CUDA Graphs CUDA_GRAPHS_USE_NODE_PRIORITY 0 or 1 Overrides the cudaGraphInstantiateFlagUseNodePriority flag on graph instantiation. When set to 1, the flag will be set for all graphs and when set to 0, the flag will be cleared for all graphs.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 163, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#cuda-graphs", "display_name": "CUDA Graphs", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "cuda-graphs", "priority": -1, "content": "CUDA Graphs present a new model for work submission in CUDA. A graph is a series of operations, such as kernel launches, connected by dependencies, which is defined separately from its execution. This allows a graph to be defined once and then launched repeatedly. Separating out the definition of a graph from its execution enables a number of optimizations: first, CPU launch costs are reduced compared to streams, because much of the setup is done in advance; second, presenting the whole workflow to CUDA enables optimizations which might not be possible with the piecewise work submission mechanism of streams. To see the optimizations possible with graphs, consider what happens in a stream: when you place a kernel into a stream, the host driver performs a sequence of operations in preparation for the execution of the kernel on the GPU. These operations, necessary for setting up and launching the kernel, are an overhead cost which must be paid for each kernel that is issued. For a GPU kernel with a short execution time, this overhead cost can be a significant fraction of the overall end-to-end execution time. Work submission using graphs is separated into three distinct stages: definition, instantiation, and execution. During the definition phase, a program creates a description of the operations in the graph along with the dependencies between them. Instantiation takes a snapshot of the graph template, validates it, and performs much of the setup and initialization of work with the aim of minimizing what needs to be done at launch. The resulting instance is known as an executable graph. An executable graph may be launched into a stream, similar to any other CUDA work. It may be launched any number of times without repeating the instantiation.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 164, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#cuda-runtime", "display_name": "CUDA Runtime", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "cuda-runtime", "priority": -1, "content": "The runtime is implemented in the cudart library, which is linked to the application, either statically via cudart.lib or libcudart.a , or dynamically via cudart.dll or libcudart.so .

In particular, this feature is useful for CUDA Graphs and stream capture . Various resource management schemes are not compatible with CUDA graphs. Consider for example an event-based pool or a synchronous-create, asynchronous-destroy scheme. // Library API with pool allocation void libraryWork(cudaStream_t stream) { auto &amp;resource = pool.claimTemporaryResource(); resource.waitOnReadyEventInStream(stream); launchWork(stream, resource); resource.recordReadyEvent(stream); } // Library API with asynchronous resource deletion void libraryWork(cudaStream_t stream) { Resource *resource = new Resource(...); launchWork(stream, resource); cudaStreamAddCallback( stream, [](cudaStream_t, cudaError_t, void *resource) { delete static_cast&lt;Resource *&gt;(resource); }, resource, 0); // Error handling considerations not shown } These schemes are difficult with CUDA graphs because of the non-fixed pointer or handle for the resource which requires indirection or graph update, and the synchronous CPU code needed each time the work is submitted. They also do not work with stream capture if these considerations are hidden from the caller of the library, and because of use of disallowed APIs during capture. Various solutions exist such as exposing the resource to the caller. CUDA user objects present another approach. A CUDA user object associates a user-specified destructor callback with an internal refcount, similar to C++ shared_ptr . References may be owned by user code on the CPU and by CUDA graphs. Note that for user-owned references, unlike C++ smart pointers, there is no object representing the reference; users must track user-owned references manually. A typical use case would be to immediately move the sole user-owned reference to a CUDA graph after the user object is created. When a reference is associated to a CUDA graph, CUDA will manage the graph operations automatically. A cloned cudaGraph_t retains a copy of every reference owned by the source cudaGraph_t , with the same multiplicity. An instantiated cudaGraphExec_t retains a copy of every reference in the source cudaGraph_t . When a cudaGraphExec_t is destroyed without being synchronized, the references are retained until the execution is completed. Here is an example use. cudaGraph_t graph; // Preexisting graph Object *object = new Object; // C++ object with possibly nontrivial destructor cudaUserObject_t cuObject; cudaUserObjectCreate( &amp;cuObject, object, // Here we use a CUDA-provided template wrapper for this API, // which supplies a callback to delete the C++ object pointer 1, // Initial refcount cudaUserObjectNoDestructorSync // Acknowledge that the callback cannot be // waited on via CUDA ); cudaGraphRetainUserObject( graph, cuObject, 1, // Number of references cudaGraphUserObjectMove // Transfer a reference owned by the caller (do // not modify the total reference count) ); // No more references owned by this thread; no need to call release API cudaGraphExec_t graphExec; cudaGraphInstantiate(&amp;graphExec, graph, nullptr, nullptr, 0); // Will retain a // new reference cudaGraphDestroy(graph); // graphExec still owns a reference cudaGraphLaunch(graphExec, 0); // Async launch has access to the user objects cudaGraphExecDestroy(graphExec); // Launch is not synchronized; the release // will be deferred if needed cudaStreamSynchronize(0); // After the launch is synchronized, the remaining // reference is released and the destructor will // execute. Note this happens asynchronously. // If the destructor callback had signaled a synchronization object, it would // be safe to wait on it at this point. References owned by graphs in child graph nodes are associated to the child graphs, not the parents. If a child graph is updated or deleted, the references change accordingly. If an executable graph or child graph is updated with cudaGraphExecUpdate or cudaGraphExecChildGraphNodeSetParams , the references in the new source graph are cloned and replace the references in the target graph. In either case, if previous launches are not synchronized, any references which would be released are held until the launches have finished executing. There is not currently a mechanism to wait on user object destructors via a CUDA API. Users may signal a synchronization object manually from the destructor code. In addition, it is not legal to call CUDA APIs from the destructor, similar to the restriction on cudaLaunchHostFunc . This is to avoid blocking a CUDA internal shared thread and preventing forward progress. It is legal to signal another thread to perform an API call, if the dependency is one way and the thread doing the call cannot block forward progress of CUDA work. User objects are created with cudaUserObjectCreate , which is a good starting point to browse related APIs.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 167, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#cudagetparameterbuffer", "display_name": "cudaGetParameterBuffer", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "cudagetparameterbuffer", "priority": -1, "content": "cudaGetParameterBuffer() needs to be declared at the PTX level before it\u2019s used.

Instantiating a graph with the cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch flag allows the graph to be relaunched while it still has unfreed allocations. In this case, the launch automatically inserts an asynchronous free of the unfreed allocations. Auto free on launch is useful for single-producer multiple-consumer algorithms. At each iteration, a producer graph creates several allocations, and, depending on runtime conditions, a varying set of consumers accesses those allocations. This type of variable execution sequence means that consumers cannot free the allocations because a subsequent consumer may require access. Auto free on launch means that the launch loop does not need to track the producer\u2019s allocations - instead, that information remains isolated to the producer\u2019s creation and destruction logic. In general, auto free on launch simplifies an algorithm which would otherwise need to free all the allocations owned by a graph before each relaunch. The cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch flag does not change the behavior of graph destruction. The application must explicitly free the unfreed memory in order to avoid memory leaks, even for graphs instantiated with the flag.

Combined with the system-wide virtual address space, page faulting provides several benefits. First, page faulting means that the CUDA system software doesn\u2019t need to synchronize all managed memory allocations to the GPU before each kernel launch. If a kernel running on the GPU accesses a page that is not resident in its memory, it faults, allowing the page to be automatically migrated to the GPU memory on-demand.

Also, because of the overhead associated with each transfer, batching many small transfers into a single large transfer always performs better than making each transfer separately. On systems with a front-side bus, higher performance for data transfers between host and device is achieved by using page-locked host memory as described in Page-Locked Host Memory . In addition, when using mapped page-locked memory ( Mapped Memory ), there is no need to allocate any device memory and explicitly copy data between device and host memory. Data transfers are implicitly performed each time the kernel accesses the mapped memory. For maximum performance, these memory accesses must be coalesced as with accesses to global memory (see Device Memory Accesses ).

Things like passing NULL as the pfn variable or passing invalid flags . The second error type encodes in the CUdriverProcAddressQueryResult *symbolStatus and can be used to help distinguish potential issues with the driver not being able to find the symbol requested. Take the following example: // cuDeviceGetExecAffinitySupport was introduced in release CUDA 11.4 #include &lt;cuda.h&gt; CUdriverProcAddressQueryResult driverStatus; cudaVersion = ...; status = cuGetProcAddress(&quot;cuDeviceGetExecAffinitySupport&quot;, &amp;pfn, cudaVersion, 0, &amp;driverStatus); if (CUDA_SUCCESS == status) { if (CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_VERSION_NOT_SUFFICIENT == driverStatus) { printf(&quot;We can use the new feature when you upgrade cudaVersion to 11.4, but CUDA driver is good to go!\\n&quot;); // Indicating cudaVersion was &lt; 11.4 but run against a CUDA driver &gt;= 11.4 } else if (CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND == driverStatus) { printf(&quot;Please update both CUDA driver and cudaVersion to at least 11.4 to use the new feature!\\n&quot;); // Indicating driver is &lt; 11.4 since string not found, doesn&#x27;t matter what cudaVersion was } else if (CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SUCCESS == driverStatus &amp;&amp; pfn) { printf(&quot;You&#x27;re using cudaVersion and CUDA driver &gt;= 11.4, using new feature!\\n&quot;); pfn(); } } The first case with the return code CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_VERSION_NOT_SUFFICIENT indicates that the symbol was found when searching in the CUDA driver but it was added later than the cudaVersion supplied. In the example, specifying cudaVersion as anything 11030 or less and when running against a CUDA driver &gt;= CUDA 11.4 would give this result of CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_VERSION_NOT_SUFFICIENT . This is because cuDeviceGetExecAffinitySupport was added in CUDA 11.4 (11040). The second case with the return code CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND indicates that the symbol was not found when searching in the CUDA driver. This can be due to a few reasons such as unsupported CUDA function due to older driver as well as just having a typo. In the latter, similar to the last example if the user had put symbol as CUDeviceGetExecAffinitySupport - notice the capital CU to start the string - cuGetProcAddress would not be able to find the API because the string doesn\u2019t match. In the former case an example might be the user developing an application against a CUDA driver supporting the new API, and deploying the application against an older CUDA driver. Using the last example, if the developer developed against CUDA 11.4 or later but was deployed against a CUDA 11.3 driver, during their development they may have had a succesful cuGetProcAddress , but when deploying an application running against a CUDA 11.3 driver the call would no longer work with the CU_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND returned in driverStatus .", "keywords": []}, {"id": 200, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#device", "display_name": "__device__", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "device", "priority": -1, "content": "The __device__ execution space specifier declares a function that is: Executed on the device, Callable from the device only.

Kernels operate out of device memory, so the runtime provides functions to allocate, deallocate, and copy device memory, as well as transfer data between host memory and device memory. Device memory can be allocated either as linear memory or as CUDA arrays . CUDA arrays are opaque memory layouts optimized for texture fetching. They are described in Texture and Surface Memory . Linear memory is allocated in a single unified address space, which means that separately allocated entities can reference one another via pointers, for example, in a binary tree or linked list. The size of the address space depends on the host system (CPU) and the compute capability of the used GPU: x86_64 (AMD64) POWER (ppc64le) ARM64 up to compute capability 5.3 (Maxwell) 40bit 40bit 40bit compute capability 6.0 (Pascal) or newer up to 47bit up to 49bit up to 48bit On devices of compute capability 5.3 (Maxwell) and earlier, the CUDA driver creates an uncommitted 40bit virtual address reservation to ensure that memory allocations (pointers) fall into the supported range. This reservation appears as reserved virtual memory, but does not occupy any physical memory until the program actually allocates memory. Linear memory is typically allocated using cudaMalloc() and freed using cudaFree() and data transfer between host memory and device memory are typically done using cudaMemcpy() . In the vector addition code sample of Kernels , the vectors need to be copied from host memory to device memory: // Device code __global__ void VecAdd(float* A, float* B, float* C, int N) { int i = blockDim.x * blockIdx.x + threadIdx.x; if (i &lt; N) C[i] = A[i] + B[i]; } // Host code int main() { int N = ...; size_t size = N * sizeof(float); // Allocate input vectors h_A and h_B in host memory float* h_A = (float*)malloc(size); float* h_B = (float*)malloc(size); float* h_C = (float*)malloc(size); // Initialize input vectors ... // Allocate vectors in device memory float* d_A; cudaMalloc(&amp;d_A, size); float* d_B; cudaMalloc(&amp;d_B, size); float* d_C; cudaMalloc(&amp;d_C, size); // Copy vectors from host memory to device memory cudaMemcpy(d_A, h_A, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice); cudaMemcpy(d_B, h_B, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice); // Invoke kernel int threadsPerBlock = 256; int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock; VecAdd&lt;&lt;&lt;blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock&gt;&gt;&gt;(d_A, d_B, d_C, N); // Copy result from device memory to host memory // h_C contains the result in host memory cudaMemcpy(h_C, d_C, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost); // Free device memory cudaFree(d_A); cudaFree(d_B); cudaFree(d_C); // Free host memory ... } Linear memory can also be allocated through cudaMallocPitch() and cudaMalloc3D() . These functions are recommended for allocations of 2D or 3D arrays as it makes sure that the allocation is appropriately padded to meet the alignment requirements described in Device Memory Accesses , therefore ensuring best performance when accessing the row addresses or performing copies between 2D arrays and other regions of device memory (using the cudaMemcpy2D() and cudaMemcpy3D() functions). The returned pitch (or stride) must be used to access array elements. The following code sample allocates a width x height 2D array of floating-point values and shows how to loop over the array elements in device code: // Host code int width = 64, height = 64; float* devPtr; size_t pitch; cudaMallocPitch(&amp;devPtr, &amp;pitch, width * sizeof(float), height); MyKernel&lt;&lt;&lt;100, 512&gt;&gt;&gt;(devPtr, pitch, width, height); // Device code __global__ void MyKernel(float* devPtr, size_t pitch, int width, int height) { for (int r = 0; r &lt; height; ++r) { float* row = (float*)((char*)devPtr + r * pitch); for (int c = 0; c &lt; width; ++c) { float element = row[c]; } } } The following code sample allocates a width x height x depth 3D array of floating-point values and shows how to loop over the array elements in device code: // Host code int width = 64, height = 64, depth = 64; cudaExtent extent = make_cudaExtent(width * sizeof(float), height, depth); cudaPitchedPtr devPitchedPtr; cudaMalloc3D(&amp;devPitchedPtr, extent); MyKernel&lt;&lt;&lt;100, 512&gt;&gt;&gt;(devPitchedPtr, width, height, depth); // Device code __global__ void MyKernel(cudaPitchedPtr devPitchedPtr, int width, int height, int depth) { char* devPtr = devPitchedPtr.ptr; size_t pitch = devPitchedPtr.pitch; size_t slicePitch = pitch * height; for (int z = 0; z &lt; depth; ++z) { char* slice = devPtr + z * slicePitch; for (int y = 0; y &lt; height; ++y) { float* row = (float*)(slice + y * pitch); for (int x = 0; x &lt; width; ++x) { float element = row[x]; } } } } To avoid allocating too much memory and thus impacting system-wide performance, request the allocation parameters from the user based on the problem size. If the allocation fails, you can fallback to other slower memory types ( cudaMallocHost() , cudaHostRegister() , etc.), or return an error telling the user how much memory was needed that was denied. If your application cannot request the allocation parameters for some reason, we recommend using cudaMallocManaged() for platforms that support it. The reference manual lists all the various functions used to copy memory between linear memory allocated with cudaMalloc() , linear memory allocated with cudaMallocPitch() or cudaMalloc3D() , CUDA arrays, and memory allocated for variables declared in global or constant memory space. The following code sample illustrates various ways of accessing global variables via the runtime API: __constant__ float constData[256]; float data[256]; cudaMemcpyToSymbol(constData, data, sizeof(data)); cudaMemcpyFromSymbol(data, constData, sizeof(data)); __device__ float devData; float value = 3.14f; cudaMemcpyToSymbol(devData, &amp;value, sizeof(float)); __device__ float* devPointer; float* ptr; cudaMalloc(&amp;ptr, 256 * sizeof(float)); cudaMemcpyToSymbol(devPointer, &amp;ptr, sizeof(ptr)); cudaGetSymbolAddress() is used to retrieve the address pointing to the memory allocated for a variable declared in global memory space. The size of the allocated memory is obtained through cudaGetSymbolSize() .", "keywords": []}, {"id": 218, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#device-memory-accesses", "display_name": "Device Memory Accesses", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "device-memory-accesses", "priority": -1, "content": "An instruction that accesses addressable memory (i.e., global, local, shared, constant, or texture memory) might need to be re-issued multiple times depending on the distribution of the memory addresses across the threads within the warp. How the distribution affects the instruction throughput this way is specific to each type of memory and described in the following sections. For example, for global memory, as a general rule, the more scattered the addresses are, the more reduced the throughput is. Global Memory Global memory resides in device memory and device memory is accessed via 32-, 64-, or 128-byte memory transactions. These memory transactions must be naturally aligned: Only the 32-, 64-, or 128-byte segments of device memory that are aligned to their size (i.e., whose first address is a multiple of their size) can be read or written by memory transactions. When a warp executes an instruction that accesses global memory, it coalesces the memory accesses of the threads within the warp into one or more of these memory transactions depending on the size of the word accessed by each thread and the distribution of the memory addresses across the threads. In general, the more transactions are necessary, the more unused words are transferred in addition to the words accessed by the threads, reducing the instruction throughput accordingly. For example, if a 32-byte memory transaction is generated for each thread\u2019s 4-byte access, throughput is divided by 8. How many transactions are necessary and how much throughput is ultimately affected varies with the compute capability of the device. Compute Capability 5.x , Compute Capability 6.x , Compute Capability 7.x , Compute Capability 8.x and Compute Capability 9.0 give more details on how global memory accesses are handled for various compute capabilities. To maximize global memory throughput, it is therefore important to maximize coalescing by: Following the most optimal access patterns based on Compute Capability 5.x , Compute Capability 6.x , Compute Capability 7.x , Compute Capability 8.x and Compute Capability 9.0 Using data types that meet the size and alignment requirement detailed in the section Size and Alignment Requirement below, Padding data in some cases, for example, when accessing a two-dimensional array as described in the section Two-Dimensional Arrays below. Size and Alignment Requirement Global memory instructions support reading or writing words of size equal to 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bytes. Any access (via a variable or a pointer) to data residing in global memory compiles to a single global memory instruction if and only if the size of the data type is 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bytes and the data is naturally aligned (i.e., its address is a multiple of that size). If this size and alignment requirement is not fulfilled, the access compiles to multiple instructions with interleaved access patterns that prevent these instructions from fully coalescing. It is therefore recommended to use types that meet this requirement for data that resides in global memory. The alignment requirement is automatically fulfilled for the Built-in Vector Types . For structures, the size and alignment requirements can be enforced by the compiler using the alignment specifiers __align__(8) or __align__(16) , such as struct __align__(8) { float x; float y; }; or struct __align__(16) { float x; float y; float z; }; Any address of a variable residing in global memory or returned by one of the memory allocation routines from the driver or runtime API is always aligned to at least 256 bytes. Reading non-naturally aligned 8-byte or 16-byte words produces incorrect results (off by a few words), so special care must be taken to maintain alignment of the starting address of any value or array of values of these types. A typical case where this might be easily overlooked is when using some custom global memory allocation scheme, whereby the allocations of multiple arrays (with multiple calls to cudaMalloc() or cuMemAlloc() ) is replaced by the allocation of a single large block of memory partitioned into multiple arrays, in which case the starting address of each array is offset from the block\u2019s starting address. Two-Dimensional Arrays A common global memory access pattern is when each thread of index (tx,ty) uses the following address to access one element of a 2D array of width width , located at address BaseAddress of type type* (where type meets the requirement described in Maximize Utilization ): BaseAddress + width * ty + tx For these accesses to be fully coalesced, both the width of the thread block and the width of the array must be a multiple of the warp size. In particular, this means that an array whose width is not a multiple of this size will be accessed much more efficiently if it is actually allocated with a width rounded up to the closest multiple of this size and its rows padded accordingly. The cudaMallocPitch() and cuMemAllocPitch() functions and associated memory copy functions described in the reference manual enable programmers to write non-hardware-dependent code to allocate arrays that conform to these constraints. Local Memory Local memory accesses only occur for some automatic variables as mentioned in Variable Memory Space Specifiers . Automatic variables that the compiler is likely to place in local memory are: Arrays for which it cannot determine that they are indexed with constant quantities, Large structures or arrays that would consume too much register space, Any variable if the kernel uses more registers than available (this is also known as register spilling ). Inspection of the PTX assembly code (obtained by compiling with the -ptx or -keep option) will tell if a variable has been placed in local memory during the first compilation phases as it will be declared using the .local mnemonic and accessed using the ld.local and st.local mnemonics. Even if it has not, subsequent compilation phases might still decide otherwise though if they find it consumes too much register space for the targeted architecture: Inspection of the cubin object using cuobjdump will tell if this is the case. Also, the compiler reports total local memory usage per kernel ( lmem ) when compiling with the --ptxas-options=-v option. Note that some mathematical functions have implementation paths that might access local memory. The local memory space resides in device memory, so local memory accesses have the same high latency and low bandwidth as global memory accesses and are subject to the same requirements for memory coalescing as described in Device Memory Accesses . Local memory is however organized such that consecutive 32-bit words are accessed by consecutive thread IDs. Accesses are therefore fully coalesced as long as all threads in a warp access the same relative address (for example, same index in an array variable, same member in a structure variable). On devices of compute capability 5.x onwards, local memory accesses are always cached in L2 in the same way as global memory accesses (see Compute Capability 5.x and Compute Capability 6.x ). Shared Memory Because it is on-chip, shared memory has much higher bandwidth and much lower latency than local or global memory. To achieve high bandwidth, shared memory is divided into equally-sized memory modules, called banks, which can be accessed simultaneously. Any memory read or write request made of n addresses that fall in n distinct memory banks can therefore be serviced simultaneously, yielding an overall bandwidth that is n times as high as the bandwidth of a single module. However, if two addresses of a memory request fall in the same memory bank, there is a bank conflict and the access has to be serialized. The hardware splits a memory request with bank conflicts into as many separate conflict-free requests as necessary, decreasing throughput by a factor equal to the number of separate memory requests. If the number of separate memory requests is n , the initial memory request is said to cause n -way bank conflicts. To get maximum performance, it is therefore important to understand how memory addresses map to memory banks in order to schedule the memory requests so as to minimize bank conflicts. This is described in Compute Capability 5.x , Compute Capability 6.x , Compute Capability 7.x , Compute Capability 8.x , and Compute Capability 9.0 for devices of compute capability 5.x, 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.0 respectively. Constant Memory The constant memory space resides in device memory and is cached in the constant cache. A request is then split into as many separate requests as there are different memory addresses in the initial request, decreasing throughput by a factor equal to the number of separate requests. The resulting requests are then serviced at the throughput of the constant cache in case of a cache hit, or at the throughput of device memory otherwise. Texture and Surface Memory The texture and surface memory spaces reside in device memory and are cached in texture cache, so a texture fetch or surface read costs one memory read from device memory only on a cache miss, otherwise it just costs one read from texture cache. The texture cache is optimized for 2D spatial locality, so threads of the same warp that read texture or surface addresses that are close together in 2D will achieve best performance. Also, it is designed for streaming fetches with a constant latency; a cache hit reduces DRAM bandwidth demand but not fetch latency. Reading device memory through texture or surface fetching present some benefits that can make it an advantageous alternative to reading device memory from global or constant memory: If the memory reads do not follow the access patterns that global or constant memory reads must follow to get good performance, higher bandwidth can be achieved providing that there is locality in the texture fetches or surface reads; Addressing calculations are performed outside the kernel by dedicated units; Packed data may be broadcast to separate variables in a single operation; 8-bit and 16-bit integer input data may be optionally converted to 32 bit floating-point values in the range [0.0, 1.0] or [-1.0, 1.0] (see Texture Memory ).", "keywords": []}, {"id": 219, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#device-memory-l2-access-management", "display_name": "Device Memory L2 Access Management", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "device-memory-l2-access-management", "priority": -1, "content": "When a CUDA kernel accesses a data region in the global memory repeatedly, such data accesses can be considered to be persisting .

Pass an existing tensor map, the template_tensor_map , to the kernel. In contrast to kernels that use the tensor map in a cp.async.bulk.tensor instruction, this may be done in any way: a pointer to global memory, kernel parameter, a __const___ variable, and so on. Copy-initialize a tensor map in shared memory with the template_tensor_map value. Modify the tensor map in shared memory using the cuda::ptx::tensormap_replace functions. These functions wrap the tensormap.replace PTX instruction, which can be used to modify any field of a tiled-type tensor map, including the base address, size, stride, and so on. Using the cuda::ptx::tensormap_copy_fenceproxy function, copy the modified tensor map from shared memory to global memory and perform any necessary fencing. The following code contains a kernel that follows these steps. For completeness, it modifies all the fields of the tensor map. Typically, a kernel will modify just a few fields. In this kernel, template_tensor_map is passed as a kernel parameter. This is the preferred way of moving template_tensor_map from the host to the device. If the kernel is intended to update an existing tensor map in device memory, it can take a pointer to the existing tensor map to modify. The format of the tensor map may change over time. Therefore, the cuda::ptx::tensormap_replace functions and corresponding tensormap.replace.tile PTX instructions are marked as specific to sm_90a. To use them, compile using nvcc -arch sm_90a .... . On sm_90a, a zero-initialized buffer in shared memory may also be used as the initial tensor map value. This enables encoding a tensor map purely on device, without using the driver API to encode the template_tensor_map value .

This partitioned shared memory is called Distributed Shared Memory , and the corresponding address space is called Distributed shared memory address space. Threads that belong to a thread block cluster, can read, write or perform atomics in the distributed address space, regardless whether the address belongs to the local thread block or a remote thread block. Whether a kernel uses distributed shared memory or not, the shared memory size specifications, static or dynamic is still per thread block. The size of distributed shared memory is just the number of thread blocks per cluster multiplied by the size of shared memory per thread block. Accessing data in distributed shared memory requires all the thread blocks to exist. A user can guarantee that all thread blocks have started executing using cluster.sync() from Cluster Group API. The user also needs to ensure that all distributed shared memory operations happen before the exit of a thread block, e.g., if a remote thread block is trying to read a given thread block\u2019s shared memory, user needs to ensure that the shared memory read by remote thread block is completed before it can exit. CUDA provides a mechanism to access to distributed shared memory, and applications can benefit from leveraging its capabilities. Lets look at a simple histogram computation and how to optimize it on the GPU using thread block cluster. A standard way of computing histograms is do the computation in the shared memory of each thread block and then perform global memory atomics. A limitation of this approach is the shared memory capacity. Once the histogram bins no longer fit in the shared memory, a user needs to directly compute histograms and hence the atomics in the global memory. With distributed shared memory, CUDA provides an intermediate step, where a depending on the histogram bins size, histogram can be computed in shared memory, distributed shared memory or global memory directly. The CUDA kernel example below shows how to compute histograms in shared memory or distributed shared memory, depending on the number of histogram bins. #include &lt;cooperative_groups.h&gt; // Distributed Shared memory histogram kernel __global__ void clusterHist_kernel(int *bins, const int nbins, const int bins_per_block, const int *__restrict__ input, size_t array_size) { extern __shared__ int smem[]; namespace cg = cooperative_groups; int tid = cg::this_grid().thread_rank(); // Cluster initialization, size and calculating local bin offsets. cg::cluster_group cluster = cg::this_cluster(); unsigned int clusterBlockRank = cluster.block_rank(); int cluster_size = cluster.dim_blocks().x; for (int i = threadIdx.x; i &lt; bins_per_block; i += blockDim.x) { smem[i] = 0; //Initialize shared memory histogram to zeros } // cluster synchronization ensures that shared memory is initialized to zero in // all thread blocks in the cluster. It also ensures that all thread blocks // have started executing and they exist concurrently. cluster.sync(); for (int i = tid; i &lt; array_size; i += blockDim.x * gridDim.x) { int ldata = input[i]; //Find the right histogram bin. int binid = ldata; if (ldata &lt; 0) binid = 0; else if (ldata &gt;= nbins) binid = nbins - 1; //Find destination block rank and offset for computing //distributed shared memory histogram int dst_block_rank = (int)(binid / bins_per_block); int dst_offset = binid % bins_per_block; //Pointer to target block shared memory int *dst_smem = cluster.map_shared_rank(smem, dst_block_rank); //Perform atomic update of the histogram bin atomicAdd(dst_smem + dst_offset, 1); } // cluster synchronization is required to ensure all distributed shared // memory operations are completed and no thread block exits while // other thread blocks are still accessing distributed shared memory cluster.sync(); // Perform global memory histogram, using the local distributed memory histogram int *lbins = bins + cluster.block_rank() * bins_per_block; for (int i = threadIdx.x; i &lt; bins_per_block; i += blockDim.x) { atomicAdd(&amp;lbins[i], smem[i]); } } The above kernel can be launched at runtime with a cluster size depending on the amount of distributed shared memory required. If histogram is small enough to fit in shared memory of just one block, user can launch kernel with cluster size 1. The code snippet below shows how to launch a cluster kernel dynamically based depending on shared memory requirements. // Launch via extensible launch { cudaLaunchConfig_t config = {0}; config.gridDim = array_size / threads_per_block; config.blockDim = threads_per_block; // cluster_size depends on the histogram size. // ( cluster_size == 1 ) implies no distributed shared memory, just thread block local shared memory int cluster_size = 2; // size 2 is an example here int nbins_per_block = nbins / cluster_size; //dynamic shared memory size is per block. //Distributed shared memory size = cluster_size * nbins_per_block * sizeof(int) config.dynamicSmemBytes = nbins_per_block * sizeof(int); CUDA_CHECK(::cudaFuncSetAttribute((void *)clusterHist_kernel, cudaFuncAttributeMaxDynamicSharedMemorySize, config.dynamicSmemBytes)); cudaLaunchAttribute attribute[1]; attribute[0].id = cudaLaunchAttributeClusterDimension; attribute[0].val.clusterDim.x = cluster_size; attribute[0].val.clusterDim.y = 1; attribute[0].val.clusterDim.z = 1; config.numAttrs = 1; config.attrs = attribute; cudaLaunchKernelEx(&amp;config, clusterHist_kernel, bins, nbins, nbins_per_block, input, array_size); }", "keywords": []}, {"id": 240, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#document-structure", "display_name": "Document Structure", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "document-structure", "priority": -1, "content": "This document is organized into the following sections: Introduction is a general introduction to CUDA.

The driver API is implemented in the cuda dynamic library ( cuda.dll or cuda.so ) which is copied on the system during the installation of the device driver. All its entry points are prefixed with cu. It is a handle-based, imperative API: Most objects are referenced by opaque handles that may be specified to functions to manipulate the objects. The objects available in the driver API are summarized in Table 22 . Object Handle Description Device CUdevice CUDA-enabled device Context CUcontext Roughly equivalent to a CPU process Module CUmodule Roughly equivalent to a dynamic library Function CUfunction Kernel Heap memory CUdeviceptr Pointer to device memory CUDA array CUarray Opaque container for one-dimensional or two-dimensional data on the device, readable via texture or surface references Texture object CUtexref Object that describes how to interpret texture memory data Surface reference CUsurfref Object that describes how to read or write CUDA arrays Stream CUstream Object that describes a CUDA stream Event CUevent Object that describes a CUDA event The driver API must be initialized with cuInit() before any function from the driver API is called. A CUDA context must then be created that is attached to a specific device and made current to the calling host thread as detailed in Context . Within a CUDA context, kernels are explicitly loaded as PTX or binary objects by the host code as described in Module . Kernels written in C++ must therefore be compiled separately into PTX or binary objects. Kernels are launched using API entry points as described in Kernel Execution . Any application that wants to run on future device architectures must load PTX , not binary code. This is because binary code is architecture-specific and therefore incompatible with future architectures, whereas PTX code is compiled to binary code at load time by the device driver. Here is the host code of the sample from Kernels written using the driver API: int main() { int N = ...; size_t size = N * sizeof(float); // Allocate input vectors h_A and h_B in host memory float* h_A = (float*)malloc(size); float* h_B = (float*)malloc(size); // Initialize input vectors ... // Initialize cuInit(0); // Get number of devices supporting CUDA int deviceCount = 0; cuDeviceGetCount(&amp;deviceCount); if (deviceCount == 0) { printf(&quot;There is no device supporting CUDA.\\n&quot;); exit (0); } // Get handle for device 0 CUdevice cuDevice; cuDeviceGet(&amp;cuDevice, 0); // Create context CUcontext cuContext; cuCtxCreate(&amp;cuContext, 0, cuDevice); // Create module from binary file CUmodule cuModule; cuModuleLoad(&amp;cuModule, &quot;VecAdd.ptx&quot;); // Allocate vectors in device memory CUdeviceptr d_A; cuMemAlloc(&amp;d_A, size); CUdeviceptr d_B; cuMemAlloc(&amp;d_B, size); CUdeviceptr d_C; cuMemAlloc(&amp;d_C, size); // Copy vectors from host memory to device memory cuMemcpyHtoD(d_A, h_A, size); cuMemcpyHtoD(d_B, h_B, size); // Get function handle from module CUfunction vecAdd; cuModuleGetFunction(&amp;vecAdd, cuModule, &quot;VecAdd&quot;); // Invoke kernel int threadsPerBlock = 256; int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock; void* args[] = { &amp;d_A, &amp;d_B, &amp;d_C, &amp;N }; cuLaunchKernel(vecAdd, blocksPerGrid, 1, 1, threadsPerBlock, 1, 1, 0, 0, args, 0); ... } Full code can be found in the vectorAddDrv CUDA sample.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 246, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#driver-function-retrieval", "display_name": "Driver Function Retrieval", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "driver-function-retrieval", "priority": -1, "content": "Using the Driver Entry Point Access APIs and the appropriate typedef, we can get the function pointer to any CUDA driver API.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 247, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#driver-function-typedefs", "display_name": "Driver Function Typedefs", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "driver-function-typedefs", "priority": -1, "content": "To help retrieve the CUDA Driver API entry points, the CUDA Toolkit provides access to headers containing the function pointer definitions for all CUDA driver APIs.

When the signature or the semantics of a specific CUDA driver API changes, we increment the version number of the corresponding driver symbol. In the case of the cuMemAlloc driver API, the first driver symbol name is cuMemAlloc and the next symbol name is cuMemAlloc_v2 . The typedef for the first version which was introduced in CUDA 2.0 (2000) is PFN_cuMemAlloc_v2000 . The typedef for the next version which was introduced in CUDA 3.2 (3020) is PFN_cuMemAlloc_v3020 . The typedefs can be used to more easily define a function pointer of the appropriate type in code: PFN_cuMemAlloc_v3020 pfn_cuMemAlloc_v2; PFN_cuMemAlloc_v2000 pfn_cuMemAlloc_v1; The above method is preferable if users are interested in a specific version of the API. Additionally, the headers have predefined macros for the latest version of all driver symbols that were available when the installed CUDA toolkit was released; these typedefs do not have a _v* suffix.

Port values are specific to node type and direction, and edge types may be restricted to specific node types. In all cases, zero-initialized edge data represents default behavior. Outgoing port 0 waits on an entire task, incoming port 0 blocks an entire task, and edge type 0 is associated with a full dependency with memory synchronizing behavior.

In a device kernel, copy the template_tensor_map , modify the copy, store in global memory, and appropriately fence. Use the tensor map in a kernel with appropriate fencing.

The only way to check for asynchronous errors just after some asynchronous function call is therefore to synchronize just after the call by calling cudaDeviceSynchronize() (or by using any other synchronization mechanisms described in Asynchronous Concurrent Execution ) and checking the error code returned by cudaDeviceSynchronize() . The runtime maintains an error variable for each host thread that is initialized to cudaSuccess and is overwritten by the error code every time an error occurs (be it a parameter validation error or an asynchronous error). cudaPeekAtLastError() returns this variable. cudaGetLastError() returns this variable and resets it to cudaSuccess . Kernel launches do not return any error code, so cudaPeekAtLastError() or cudaGetLastError() must be called just after the kernel launch to retrieve any pre-launch errors. To ensure that any error returned by cudaPeekAtLastError() or cudaGetLastError() does not originate from calls prior to the kernel launch, one has to make sure that the runtime error variable is set to cudaSuccess just before the kernel launch, for example, by calling cudaGetLastError() just before the kernel launch. Kernel launches are asynchronous, so to check for asynchronous errors, the application must synchronize in-between the kernel launch and the call to cudaPeekAtLastError() or cudaGetLastError() . Note that cudaErrorNotReady that may be returned by cudaStreamQuery() and cudaEventQuery() is not considered an error and is therefore not reported by cudaPeekAtLastError() or cudaGetLastError() .", "keywords": []}, {"id": 260, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#events", "display_name": "Events", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "events", "priority": -1, "content": "The runtime also provides a way to closely monitor the device\u2019s progress, as well as perform accurate timing, by letting the application asynchronously record events at any point in the program, and query when these events are completed.

The execution configuration defines the dimension of the grid and blocks that will be used to execute the function on the device, as well as the associated stream (see CUDA Runtime for a description of streams). The execution configuration is specified by inserting an expression of the form &lt;&lt;&lt; Dg, Db, Ns, S &gt;&gt;&gt; between the function name and the parenthesized argument list, where: Dg is of type dim3 (see dim3 ) and specifies the dimension and size of the grid, such that Dg.x * Dg.y * Dg.z equals the number of blocks being launched; Db is of type dim3 (see dim3 ) and specifies the dimension and size of each block, such that Db.x * Db.y * Db.z equals the number of threads per block; Ns is of type size_t and specifies the number of bytes in shared memory that is dynamically allocated per block for this call in addition to the statically allocated memory; this dynamically allocated memory is used by any of the variables declared as an external array as mentioned in __shared__ ; Ns is an optional argument which defaults to 0; S is of type cudaStream_t and specifies the associated stream; S is an optional argument which defaults to 0. As an example, a function declared as __global__ void Func(float* parameter); must be called like this: Func&lt;&lt;&lt; Dg, Db, Ns &gt;&gt;&gt;(parameter); The arguments to the execution configuration are evaluated before the actual function arguments. The function call will fail if Dg or Db are greater than the maximum sizes allowed for the device as specified in Compute Capabilities , or if Ns is greater than the maximum amount of shared memory available on the device, minus the amount of shared memory required for static allocation. Compute capability 9.0 and above allows users to specify compile time thread block cluster dimensions, so that the kernel can use the cluster hierarchy in CUDA. Compile time cluster dimension can be specified using __cluster_dims__([x, [y, [z]]]) .

Unified Memory uses logical activity to determine whether the GPU is idle. This aligns with the CUDA programming model, which specifies that a kernel can run at any time following a launch and is not guaranteed to have finished until the host issues a synchronization call. Any function call that logically guarantees the GPU completes its work is valid. This includes cudaDeviceSynchronize() ; cudaStreamSynchronize() and cudaStreamQuery() (provided it returns cudaSuccess and not cudaErrorNotReady ) where the specified stream is the only stream still executing on the GPU; cudaEventSynchronize() and cudaEventQuery() in cases where the specified event is not followed by any device work; as well as uses of cudaMemcpy() and cudaMemset() that are documented as being fully synchronous with respect to the host. Dependencies created between streams will be followed to infer completion of other streams by synchronizing on a stream or event. Dependencies can be created via cudaStreamWaitEvent() or implicitly when using the default (NULL) stream. It is legal for the CPU to access managed data from within a stream callback, provided no other stream that could potentially be accessing managed data is active on the GPU. In addition, a callback that is not followed by any device work can be used for synchronization: for example, by signaling a condition variable from inside the callback; otherwise, CPU access is valid only for the duration of the callback(s). There are several important points of note: It is always permitted for the CPU to access non-managed zero-copy data while the GPU is active. The GPU is considered active when it is running any kernel, even if that kernel does not make use of managed data. If a kernel might use data, then access is forbidden, unless device property concurrentManagedAccess is 1. There are no constraints on concurrent inter-GPU access of managed memory, other than those that apply to multi-GPU access of non-managed memory. There are no constraints on concurrent GPU kernels accessing managed data. Note how the last point allows for races between GPU kernels, as is currently the case for non-managed GPU memory. As mentioned previously, managed memory functions identically to non-managed memory from the perspective of the GPU. The following code example illustrates these points: int main() { cudaStream_t stream1, stream2; cudaStreamCreate(&amp;stream1); cudaStreamCreate(&amp;stream2); int *non_managed, *managed, *also_managed; cudaMallocHost(&amp;non_managed, 4); // Non-managed, CPU-accessible memory cudaMallocManaged(&amp;managed, 4); cudaMallocManaged(&amp;also_managed, 4); // Point 1: CPU can access non-managed data. kernel&lt;&lt;&lt; 1, 1, 0, stream1 &gt;&gt;&gt;(managed); *non_managed = 1; // Point 2: CPU cannot access any managed data while GPU is busy, // unless concurrentManagedAccess = 1 // Note we have not yet synchronized, so &quot;kernel&quot; is still active. *also_managed = 2; // Will issue segmentation fault // Point 3: Concurrent GPU kernels can access the same data. kernel&lt;&lt;&lt; 1, 1, 0, stream2 &gt;&gt;&gt;(managed); // Point 4: Multi-GPU concurrent access is also permitted. cudaSetDevice(1); kernel&lt;&lt;&lt; 1, 1 &gt;&gt;&gt;(managed); return 0; }", "keywords": []}, {"id": 272, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#extended-lambda-restrictions", "display_name": "Extended Lambda Restrictions", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "extended-lambda-restrictions", "priority": -1, "content": "The CUDA compiler will replace an extended lambda expression with an instance of a placeholder type defined in namespace scope, before invoking the host compiler. The template argument of the placeholder type requires taking the address of a function enclosing the original extended lambda expression. This is required for the correct execution of any __global__ function template whose template argument involves the closure type of an extended lambda. The enclosing function is computed as follows. By definition, the extended lambda is present within the immediate or nested block scope of a __host__ or __host__ __device__ function. If this function is not the operator() of a lambda expression, then it is considered the enclosing function for the extended lambda. Otherwise, the extended lambda is defined within the immediate or nested block scope of the operator() of one or more enclosing lambda expressions. If the outermost such lambda expression is defined in the immediate or nested block scope of a function F , then F is the computed enclosing function, else the enclosing function does not exist. Example: void foo(void) { // enclosing function for lam1 is &quot;foo&quot; auto lam1 = [] __device__ { }; auto lam2 = [] { auto lam3 = [] { // enclosing function for lam4 is &quot;foo&quot; auto lam4 = [] __host__ __device__ { }; }; }; } auto lam6 = [] { // enclosing function for lam7 does not exist auto lam7 = [] __host__ __device__ { }; }; Here are the restrictions on extended lambdas: An extended lambda cannot be defined inside another extended lambda expression. Example: void foo(void) { auto lam1 = [] __host__ __device__ { // error: extended lambda defined within another extended lambda auto lam2 = [] __host__ __device__ { }; }; } An extended lambda cannot be defined inside a generic lambda expression. Example: void foo(void) { auto lam1 = [] (auto) { // error: extended lambda defined within a generic lambda auto lam2 = [] __host__ __device__ { }; }; } If an extended lambda is defined within the immediate or nested block scope of one or more nested lambda expression, the outermost such lambda expression must be defined inside the immediate or nested block scope of a function. Example: auto lam1 = [] { // error: outer enclosing lambda is not defined within a // non-lambda-operator() function. auto lam2 = [] __host__ __device__ { }; }; The enclosing function for the extended lambda must be named and its address can be taken. If the enclosing function is a class member, then the following conditions must be satisfied: All classes enclosing the member function must have a name. The member function must not have private or protected access within its parent class. All enclosing classes must not have private or protected access within their respective parent classes. Example: void foo(void) { // OK auto lam1 = [] __device__ { return 0; }; { // OK auto lam2 = [] __device__ { return 0; }; // OK auto lam3 = [] __device__ __host__ { return 0; }; } } struct S1_t { S1_t(void) { // Error: cannot take address of enclosing function auto lam4 = [] __device__ { return 0; }; } }; class C0_t { void foo(void) { // Error: enclosing function has private access in parent class auto temp1 = [] __device__ { return 10; }; } struct S2_t { void foo(void) { // Error: enclosing class S2_t has private access in its // parent class auto temp1 = [] __device__ { return 10; }; } }; }; It must be possible to take the address of the enclosing routine unambiguously, at the point where the extended lambda has been defined. This may not be feasible in some cases e.g. when a class typedef shadows a template type argument of the same name. Example: template &lt;typename&gt; struct A { typedef void Bar; void test(); }; template&lt;&gt; struct A&lt;void&gt; { }; template &lt;typename Bar&gt; void A&lt;Bar&gt;::test() { /* In code sent to host compiler, nvcc will inject an address expression here, of the form: (void (A&lt; Bar&gt; ::*)(void))(&amp;A::test)) However, the class typedef &#x27;Bar&#x27; (to void) shadows the template argument &#x27;Bar&#x27;, causing the address expression in A&lt;int&gt;::test to actually refer to: (void (A&lt; void&gt; ::*)(void))(&amp;A::test)) ..which doesn&#x27;t take the address of the enclosing routine &#x27;A&lt;int&gt;::test&#x27; correctly. */ auto lam1 = [] __host__ __device__ { return 4; }; } int main() { A&lt;int&gt; xxx; xxx.test(); } An extended lambda cannot be defined in a class that is local to a function. Example: void foo(void) { struct S1_t { void bar(void) { // Error: bar is member of a class that is local to a function. auto lam4 = [] __host__ __device__ { return 0; }; } }; } The enclosing function for an extended lambda cannot have deduced return type. Example: auto foo(void) { // Error: the return type of foo is deduced. auto lam1 = [] __host__ __device__ { return 0; }; } __host__ __device__ extended lambdas cannot be generic lambdas. Example: void foo(void) { // Error: __host__ __device__ extended lambdas cannot be // generic lambdas. auto lam1 = [] __host__ __device__ (auto i) { return i; }; // Error: __host__ __device__ extended lambdas cannot be // generic lambdas. auto lam2 = [] __host__ __device__ (auto ...i) { return sizeof...(i); }; } If the enclosing function is an instantiation of a function template or a member function template, and/or the function is a member of a class template, the template(s) must satisfy the following constraints: The template must have at most one variadic parameter, and it must be listed last in the template parameter list. The template parameters must be named. The template instantiation argument types cannot involve types that are either local to a function (except for closure types for extended lambdas), or are private or protected class members. Example: template &lt;typename T&gt; __global__ void kern(T in) { in(); } template &lt;typename... T&gt; struct foo {}; template &lt; template &lt;typename...&gt; class T, typename... P1, typename... P2&gt; void bar1(const T&lt;P1...&gt;, const T&lt;P2...&gt;) { // Error: enclosing function has multiple parameter packs auto lam1 = [] __device__ { return 10; }; } template &lt; template &lt;typename...&gt; class T, typename... P1, typename T2&gt; void bar2(const T&lt;P1...&gt;, T2) { // Error: for enclosing function, the // parameter pack is not last in the template parameter list. auto lam1 = [] __device__ { return 10; }; } template &lt;typename T, T&gt; void bar3(void) { // Error: for enclosing function, the second template // parameter is not named. auto lam1 = [] __device__ { return 10; }; } int main() { foo&lt;char, int, float&gt; f1; foo&lt;char, int&gt; f2; bar1(f1, f2); bar2(f1, 10); bar3&lt;int, 10&gt;(); } Example: template &lt;typename T&gt; __global__ void kern(T in) { in(); } template &lt;typename T&gt; void bar4(void) { auto lam1 = [] __device__ { return 10; }; kern&lt;&lt;&lt;1,1&gt;&gt;&gt;(lam1); } struct C1_t { struct S1_t { }; friend int main(void); }; int main() { struct S1_t { }; // Error: enclosing function for device lambda in bar4 // is instantiated with a type local to main. bar4&lt;S1_t&gt;(); // Error: enclosing function for device lambda in bar4 // is instantiated with a type that is a private member // of a class. bar4&lt;C1_t::S1_t&gt;(); } With Visual Studio host compilers, the enclosing function must have external linkage. The restriction is present because this host compiler does not support using the address of non-extern linkage functions as template arguments, which is needed by the CUDA compiler transformations to support extended lambdas. With Visual Studio host compilers, an extended lambda shall not be defined within the body of an \u2018if-constexpr\u2019 block. An extended lambda has the following restrictions on captured variables: In the code sent to the host compiler, the variable may be passed by value to a sequence of helper functions before being used to direct-initialize the field of the class type used to represent the closure type for the extended lambda 31 . A variable can only be captured by value. A variable of array type cannot be captured if the number of array dimensions is greater than 7. For a variable of array type, in the code sent to the host compiler, the closure type\u2019s array field is first default-initialized, and then each element of the array field is copy-assigned from the corresponding element of the captured array variable. Therefore, the array element type must be default-constructible and copy-assignable in host code. A function parameter that is an element of a variadic argument pack cannot be captured. The type of the captured variable cannot involve types that are either local to a function (except for closure types of extended lambdas), or are private or protected class members. For a __host__ __device__ extended lambda, the types used in the return or parameter types of the lambda expression\u2019s operator() cannot involve types that are either local to a function (except for closure types of extended lambdas), or are private or protected class members. Init-capture is not supported for __host__ __device__ extended lambdas. Init-capture is supported for __device__ extended lambdas, except when the init-capture is of array type or of type std::initializer_list . The function call operator for an extended lambda is not constexpr. The closure type for an extended lambda is not a literal type. The constexpr and consteval specifier cannot be used in the declaration of an extended lambda. A variable cannot be implicitly captured inside an if-constexpr block lexically nested inside an extended lambda, unless it has already been implicitly captured earlier outside the if-constexpr block or appears in the explicit capture list for the extended lambda (see example below). Example void foo(void) { // OK: an init-capture is allowed for an // extended __device__ lambda. auto lam1 = [x = 1] __device__ () { return x; }; // Error: an init-capture is not allowed for // an extended __host__ __device__ lambda. auto lam2 = [x = 1] __host__ __device__ () { return x; }; int a = 1; // Error: an extended __device__ lambda cannot capture // variables by reference. auto lam3 = [&amp;a] __device__ () { return a; }; // Error: by-reference capture is not allowed // for an extended __device__ lambda. auto lam4 = [&amp;x = a] __device__ () { return x; }; struct S1_t { }; S1_t s1; // Error: a type local to a function cannot be used in the type // of a captured variable. auto lam6 = [s1] __device__ () { }; // Error: an init-capture cannot be of type std::initializer_list. auto lam7 = [x = {11}] __device__ () { }; std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt; b = {11,22,33}; // Error: an init-capture cannot be of type std::initializer_list. auto lam8 = [x = b] __device__ () { }; // Error scenario (lam9) and supported scenarios (lam10, lam11) // for capture within &#x27;if-constexpr&#x27; block int yyy = 4; auto lam9 = [=] __device__ { int result = 0; if constexpr(false) { //Error: An extended __device__ lambda cannot first-capture // &#x27;yyy&#x27; in constexpr-if context result += yyy; } return result; }; auto lam10 = [yyy] __device__ { int result = 0; if constexpr(false) { //OK: &#x27;yyy&#x27; already listed in explicit capture list for the extended lambda result += yyy; } return result; }; auto lam11 = [=] __device__ { int result = yyy; if constexpr(false) { //OK: &#x27;yyy&#x27; already implicit captured outside the &#x27;if-constexpr&#x27; block result += yyy; } return result; }; } When parsing a function, the CUDA compiler assigns a counter value to each extended lambda within that function. This counter value is used in the substituted named type passed to the host compiler. Hence, whether or not an extended lambda is defined within a function should not depend on a particular value of __CUDA_ARCH__ , or on __CUDA_ARCH__ being undefined. Example template &lt;typename T&gt; __global__ void kernel(T in) { in(); } __host__ __device__ void foo(void) { // Error: the number and relative declaration // order of extended lambdas depends on // __CUDA_ARCH__ #if defined(__CUDA_ARCH__) auto lam1 = [] __device__ { return 0; }; auto lam1b = [] __host___ __device__ { return 10; }; #endif auto lam2 = [] __device__ { return 4; }; kernel&lt;&lt;&lt;1,1&gt;&gt;&gt;(lam2); } As described above, the CUDA compiler replaces a __device__ extended lambda defined in a host function with a placeholder type defined in namespace scope. Unless the trait __nv_is_extended_device_lambda_with_preserved_return_type() returns true for the closure type of the extended lambda, the placeholder type does not define a operator() function equivalent to the original lambda declaration. An attempt to determine the return type or parameter types of the operator() function of such a lambda may therefore work incorrectly in host code, as the code processed by the host compiler will be semantically different than the input code processed by the CUDA compiler. However, it is OK to introspect the return type or parameter types of the operator() function within device code. Note that this restriction does not apply to __host__ __device__ extended lambdas, or to __device__ extended lambdas for which the trait __nv_is_extended_device_lambda_with_preserved_return_type() returns true. Example #include &lt;type_traits&gt; const char&amp; getRef(const char* p) { return *p; } void foo(void) { auto lam1 = [] __device__ { return &quot;10&quot;; }; // Error: attempt to extract the return type // of a __device__ lambda in host code std::result_of&lt;decltype(lam1)()&gt;::type xx1 = &quot;abc&quot;; auto lam2 = [] __host__ __device__ { return &quot;10&quot;; }; // OK : lam2 represents a __host__ __device__ extended lambda std::result_of&lt;decltype(lam2)()&gt;::type xx2 = &quot;abc&quot;; auto lam3 = [] __device__ () -&gt; const char * { return &quot;10&quot;; }; // OK : lam3 represents a __device__ extended lambda with preserved return type std::result_of&lt;decltype(lam3)()&gt;::type xx2 = &quot;abc&quot;; static_assert( std::is_same_v&lt; std::result_of&lt;decltype(lam3)()&gt;::type, const char *&gt;); auto lam4 = [] __device__ (char x) -&gt; decltype(getRef(&amp;x)) { return 0; }; // lam4&#x27;s return type is not preserved because it references the operator()&#x27;s // parameter types in the trailing return type. static_assert( ! __nv_is_extended_device_lambda_with_preserved_return_type(decltype(lam4)), &quot;&quot; ); } For an extended device lambda: - Introspecting the parameter type of operator() is only supported in device code. - Introspecting the return type of operator() is supported only in device code, unless the trait function __nv_is_extended_device_lambda_with_preserved_return_type() returns true. If the functor object represented by an extended lambda is passed from host to device code (e.g., as the argument of a __global__ function), then any expression in the body of the lambda expression that captures variables must be remain unchanged irrespective of whether the __CUDA_ARCH__ macro is defined, and whether the macro has a particular value. This restriction arises because the lambda\u2019s closure class layout depends on the order in which captured variables are encountered when the compiler processes the lambda expression; the program may execute incorrectly if the closure class layout differs in device and host compilation. Example __device__ int result; template &lt;typename T&gt; __global__ void kernel(T in) { result = in(); } void foo(void) { int x1 = 1; auto lam1 = [=] __host__ __device__ { // Error: &quot;x1&quot; is only captured when __CUDA_ARCH__ is defined. #ifdef __CUDA_ARCH__ return x1 + 1; #else return 10; #endif }; kernel&lt;&lt;&lt;1,1&gt;&gt;&gt;(lam1); } As described previously, the CUDA compiler replaces an extended __device__ lambda expression with an instance of a placeholder type in the code sent to the host compiler. This placeholder type does not define a pointer-to-function conversion operator in host code, however the conversion operator is provided in device code. Note that this restriction does not apply to __host__ __device__ extended lambdas. Example template &lt;typename T&gt; __global__ void kern(T in) { int (*fp)(double) = in; // OK: conversion in device code is supported fp(0); auto lam1 = [](double) { return 1; }; // OK: conversion in device code is supported fp = lam1; fp(0); } void foo(void) { auto lam_d = [] __device__ (double) { return 1; }; auto lam_hd = [] __host__ __device__ (double) { return 1; }; kern&lt;&lt;&lt;1,1&gt;&gt;&gt;(lam_d); kern&lt;&lt;&lt;1,1&gt;&gt;&gt;(lam_hd); // OK : conversion for __host__ __device__ lambda is supported // in host code int (*fp)(double) = lam_hd; // Error: conversion for __device__ lambda is not supported in // host code. int (*fp2)(double) = lam_d; } As described previously, the CUDA compiler replaces an extended __device__ or __host__ __device__ lambda expression with an instance of a placeholder type in the code sent to the host compiler. This placeholder type may define C++ special member functions (e.g. constructor, destructor). As a result, some standard C++ type traits may return different results for the closure type of the extended lambda, in the CUDA frontend compiler versus the host compiler. The following type traits are affected: std::is_trivially_copyable , std::is_trivially_constructible , std::is_trivially_copy_constructible , std::is_trivially_move_constructible , std::is_trivially_destructible . Care must be taken that the results of these type traits are not used in __global__ function template instantiation or in __device__ / __constant__ / __managed__ variable template instantiation. Example template &lt;bool b&gt; void __global__ foo() { printf(&quot;hi&quot;); } template &lt;typename T&gt; void dolaunch() { // ERROR: this kernel launch may fail, because CUDA frontend compiler // and host compiler may disagree on the result of // std::is_trivially_copyable() trait on the closure type of the // extended lambda foo&lt;std::is_trivially_copyable&lt;T&gt;::value&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;1,1&gt;&gt;&gt;(); cudaDeviceSynchronize(); } int main() { int x = 0; auto lam1 = [=] __host__ __device__ () { return x; }; dolaunch&lt;decltype(lam1)&gt;(); } The CUDA compiler will generate compiler diagnostics for a subset of cases described in 1-12; no diagnostic will be generated for cases 13-17, but the host compiler may fail to compile the generated code.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 273, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#extended-lambda-type-traits", "display_name": "Extended Lambda Type Traits", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "extended-lambda-type-traits", "priority": -1, "content": "The compiler provides type traits to detect closure types for extended lambdas at compile time: __nv_is_extended_device_lambda_closure_type(type) : If \u2018type\u2019 is the closure class created for an extended __device__ lambda, then the trait is true, otherwise it is false. __nv_is_extended_device_lambda_with_preserved_return_type(type) : If \u2018type\u2019 is the closure class created for an extended __device__ lambda and the lambda is defined with trailing return type (with restriction), then the trait is true, otherwise it is false.

These objects are typically exported by other APIs using handles native to the Operating System, like file descriptors on Linux or NT handles on Windows. They could also be exported using other unified interfaces such as the NVIDIA Software Communication Interface. There are two types of resources that can be imported: memory objects and synchronization objects. Memory objects can be imported into CUDA using cudaImportExternalMemory() . An imported memory object can be accessed from within kernels using device pointers mapped onto the memory object via cudaExternalMemoryGetMappedBuffer() or CUDA mipmapped arrays mapped via cudaExternalMemoryGetMappedMipmappedArray() . Depending on the type of memory object, it may be possible for more than one mapping to be setup on a single memory object. The mappings must match the mappings setup in the exporting API. Any mismatched mappings result in undefined behavior. Imported memory objects must be freed using cudaDestroyExternalMemory() . Freeing a memory object does not free any mappings to that object. Therefore, any device pointers mapped onto that object must be explicitly freed using cudaFree() and any CUDA mipmapped arrays mapped onto that object must be explicitly freed using cudaFreeMipmappedArray() . It is illegal to access mappings to an object after it has been destroyed. Synchronization objects can be imported into CUDA using cudaImportExternalSemaphore() . An imported synchronization object can then be signaled using cudaSignalExternalSemaphoresAsync() and waited on using cudaWaitExternalSemaphoresAsync() . It is illegal to issue a wait before the corresponding signal has been issued. Also, depending on the type of the imported synchronization object, there may be additional constraints imposed on how they can be signaled and waited on, as described in subsequent sections.

There is no mechanism for detecting that a floating-point exception has occurred and all operations behave as if the IEEE-754 exceptions are always masked, and deliver the masked response as defined by IEEE-754 if there is an exceptional event. For the same reason, while SNaN encodings are supported, they are not signaling and are handled as quiet. The result of a single-precision floating-point operation involving one or more input NaNs is the quiet NaN of bit pattern 0x7fffffff. Double-precision floating-point absolute value and negation are not compliant with IEEE-754 with respect to NaNs; these are passed through unchanged. Code must be compiled with -ftz=false , -prec-div=true , and -prec-sqrt=true to ensure IEEE compliance (this is the default setting; see the nvcc user manual for description of these compilation flags). Regardless of the setting of the compiler flag -ftz , atomic single-precision floating-point adds on global memory always operate in flush-to-zero mode, i.e., behave equivalent to FADD.F32.FTZ.RN , atomic single-precision floating-point adds on shared memory always operate with denormal support, i.e., behave equivalent to FADD.F32.RN . In accordance to the IEEE-754R standard, if one of the input parameters to fminf() , fmin() , fmaxf() , or fmax() is NaN, but not the other, the result is the non-NaN parameter. The conversion of a floating-point value to an integer value in the case where the floating-point value falls outside the range of the integer format is left undefined by IEEE-754. For compute devices, the behavior is to clamp to the end of the supported range. This is unlike the x86 architecture behavior. The behavior of integer division by zero and integer overflow is left undefined by IEEE-754. For compute devices, there is no mechanism for detecting that such integer operation exceptions have occurred.

Parent and child grids have coherent access to global memory, with weak consistency guarantees between child and parent. There are two points in the execution of a child grid when its view of memory is fully consistent with the parent thread: when the child grid is invoked by the parent, and when the child grid completes as signaled by a synchronization API invocation in the parent thread. Explicit synchronization with child kernels from a parent block (i.e. using cudaDeviceSynchronize() in device code) is deprecated in CUDA 11.6, removed for compute_90+ compilation, and is slated for full removal in a future CUDA release. All global memory operations in the parent thread prior to the child grid\u2019s invocation are visible to the child grid. All memory operations of the child grid are visible to the parent after the parent has synchronized on the child grid\u2019s completion. In the following example, the child grid executing child_launch is only guaranteed to see the modifications to data made before the child grid was launched. Since thread 0 of the parent is performing the launch, the child will be consistent with the memory seen by thread 0 of the parent. Due to the first __syncthreads() call, the child will see data[0]=0 , data[1]=1 , \u2026, data[255]=255 (without the __syncthreads() call, only data[0] would be guaranteed to be seen by the child).

The presence of these kernels is required by the current CUDA programming model to ensure that the thread blocks operating on one pipeline stage have produced data before the thread block operating on the next pipeline stage is ready to consume it. In such cases, the ability to provide global inter thread block synchronization would allow the application to be restructured to have persistent thread blocks, which are able to synchronize on the device when a given stage is complete.

Therefore, switching from one execution context to another has no cost, and at every instruction issue time, a warp scheduler selects a warp that has threads ready to execute its next instruction (the active threads of the warp) and issues the instruction to those threads. In particular, each multiprocessor has a set of 32-bit registers that are partitioned among the warps, and a parallel data cache or shared memory that is partitioned among the thread blocks. The number of blocks and warps that can reside and be processed together on the multiprocessor for a given kernel depends on the amount of registers and shared memory used by the kernel and the amount of registers and shared memory available on the multiprocessor. There are also a maximum number of resident blocks and a maximum number of resident warps per multiprocessor. These limits as well the amount of registers and shared memory available on the multiprocessor are a function of the compute capability of the device and are given in Compute Capabilities . If there are not enough registers or shared memory available per multiprocessor to process at least one block, the kernel will fail to launch.

The CUDA programming model also assumes that both the host and the device maintain their own separate memory spaces in DRAM, referred to as host memory and device memory , respectively. Therefore, a program manages the global, constant, and texture memory spaces visible to kernels through calls to the CUDA runtime (described in Programming Interface ). This includes device memory allocation and deallocation as well as data transfer between host and device memory. Unified Memory provides managed memory to bridge the host and device memory spaces. Managed memory is accessible from all CPUs and GPUs in the system as a single, coherent memory image with a common address space.

However, this can lead to a rather different set of threads participating in the executed code than intended if the developer made assumptions about warp-synchronicity of previous hardware architectures. Below are code patterns of concern and suggested corrective actions for Volta-safe code. For applications using warp intrinsics ( __shfl* , __any , __all , __ballot ), it is necessary that developers port their code to the new, safe, synchronizing counterpart, with the *_sync suffix. The new warp intrinsics take in a mask of threads that explicitly define which lanes (threads of a warp) must participate in the warp intrinsic. See Warp Vote Functions and Warp Shuffle Functions for details. Since the intrinsics are available with CUDA 9.0+, (if necessary) code can be executed conditionally with the following preprocessor macro: #if defined(CUDART_VERSION) &amp;&amp; CUDART_VERSION &gt;= 9000 // *_sync intrinsic #endif These intrinsics are available on all architectures, not just Volta or Turing , and in most cases a single code-base will suffice for all architectures. Note, however, that for Pascal and earlier architectures, all threads in mask must execute the same warp intrinsic instruction in convergence, and the union of all values in mask must be equal to the warp\u2019s active mask. The following code pattern is valid on Volta , but not on Pascal or earlier architectures. if (tid % warpSize &lt; 16) { ... float swapped = __shfl_xor_sync(0xffffffff, val, 16); ... } else { ... float swapped = __shfl_xor_sync(0xffffffff, val, 16); ... } The replacement for __ballot(1) is __activemask() . Note that threads within a warp can diverge even within a single code path. As a result, __activemask() and __ballot(1) may return only a subset of the threads on the current code path. The following invalid code example sets bit i of output to 1 when data[i] is greater than threshold . __activemask() is used in an attempt to enable cases where dataLen is not a multiple of 32. // Sets bit in output[] to 1 if the correspond element in data[i] // is greater than &#x27;threshold&#x27;, using 32 threads in a warp. for (int i = warpLane; i &lt; dataLen; i += warpSize) { unsigned active = __activemask(); unsigned bitPack = __ballot_sync(active, data[i] &gt; threshold); if (warpLane == 0) { output[i / 32] = bitPack; } } This code is invalid because CUDA does not guarantee that the warp will diverge ONLY at the loop condition. When divergence happens for other reasons, conflicting results will be computed for the same 32-bit output element by different subsets of threads in the warp. A correct code might use a non-divergent loop condition together with __ballot_sync() to safely enumerate the set of threads in the warp participating in the threshold calculation as follows. for (int i = warpLane; i - warpLane &lt; dataLen; i += warpSize) { unsigned active = __ballot_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, i &lt; dataLen); if (i &lt; dataLen) { unsigned bitPack = __ballot_sync(active, data[i] &gt; threshold); if (warpLane == 0) { output[i / 32] = bitPack; } } } Discovery Pattern demonstrates a valid use case for __activemask() . If applications have warp-synchronous codes, they will need to insert the new __syncwarp() warp-wide barrier synchronization instruction between any steps where data is exchanged between threads via global or shared memory. Assumptions that code is executed in lockstep or that reads/writes from separate threads are visible across a warp without synchronization are invalid. __shared__ float s_buff[BLOCK_SIZE]; s_buff[tid] = val; __syncthreads(); // Inter-warp reduction for (int i = BLOCK_SIZE / 2; i &gt;= 32; i /= 2) { if (tid &lt; i) { s_buff[tid] += s_buff[tid+i]; } __syncthreads(); } // Intra-warp reduction // Butterfly reduction simplifies syncwarp mask if (tid &lt; 32) { float temp; temp = s_buff[tid ^ 16]; __syncwarp(); s_buff[tid] += temp; __syncwarp(); temp = s_buff[tid ^ 8]; __syncwarp(); s_buff[tid] += temp; __syncwarp(); temp = s_buff[tid ^ 4]; __syncwarp(); s_buff[tid] += temp; __syncwarp(); temp = s_buff[tid ^ 2]; __syncwarp(); s_buff[tid] += temp; __syncwarp(); } if (tid == 0) { *output = s_buff[0] + s_buff[1]; } __syncthreads(); Although __syncthreads() has been consistently documented as synchronizing all threads in the thread block, Pascal and prior architectures could only enforce synchronization at the warp level. In certain cases, this allowed a barrier to succeed without being executed by every thread as long as at least some thread in every warp reached the barrier. Starting with Volta , the CUDA built-in __syncthreads() and PTX instruction bar.sync (and their derivatives) are enforced per thread and thus will not succeed until reached by all non-exited threads in the block. Code exploiting the previous behavior will likely deadlock and must be modified to ensure that all non-exited threads reach the barrier. The racecheck and synccheck tools provided by compute-saniter can help with locating violations. To aid migration while implementing the above-mentioned corrective actions, developers can opt-in to the Pascal scheduling model that does not support independent thread scheduling.

Absent these calls, the runtime will implicitly use device 0 and self-initialize as needed to process other runtime API requests. One needs to keep this in mind when timing runtime function calls and when interpreting the error code from the first call into the runtime. Before 12.0, cudaSetDevice() would not initialize the runtime and applications would often use the no-op runtime call cudaFree(0) to isolate the runtime initialization from other api activity (both for the sake of timing and error handling). The runtime creates a CUDA context for each device in the system (see Context for more details on CUDA contexts). This context is the primary context for this device and is initialized at the first runtime function which requires an active context on this device. It is shared among all the host threads of the application. As part of this context creation, the device code is just-in-time compiled if necessary (see Just-in-Time Compilation ) and loaded into device memory. This all happens transparently. If needed, for example, for driver API interoperability, the primary context of a device can be accessed from the driver API as described in Interoperability between Runtime and Driver APIs . When a host thread calls cudaDeviceReset() , this destroys the primary context of the device the host thread currently operates on (i.e., the current device as defined in Device Selection ). The next runtime function call made by any host thread that has this device as current will create a new primary context for this device. The CUDA interfaces use global state that is initialized during host program initiation and destroyed during host program termination. The CUDA runtime and driver cannot detect if this state is invalid, so using any of these interfaces (implicitly or explicitly) during program initiation or termination after main) will result in undefined behavior. As of CUDA 12.0, cudaSetDevice() will now explicitly initialize the runtime after changing the current device for the host thread. Previous versions of CUDA delayed runtime initialization on the new device until the first runtime call was made after cudaSetDevice() . This change means that it is now very important to check the return value of cudaSetDevice() for initialization errors.

The IPC API is only supported for 64-bit processes on Linux and for devices of compute capability 2.0 and higher. Note that the IPC API is not supported for cudaMallocManaged allocations. Using this API, an application can get the IPC handle for a given device memory pointer using cudaIpcGetMemHandle() , pass it to another process using standard IPC mechanisms (for example, interprocess shared memory or files), and use cudaIpcOpenMemHandle() to retrieve a device pointer from the IPC handle that is a valid pointer within this other process. Event handles can be shared using similar entry points. Note that allocations made by cudaMalloc() may be sub-allocated from a larger block of memory for performance reasons. In such case, CUDA IPC APIs will share the entire underlying memory block which may cause other sub-allocations to be shared, which can potentially lead to information disclosure between processes. To prevent this behavior, it is recommended to only share allocations with a 2MiB aligned size. An example of using the IPC API is where a single primary process generates a batch of input data, making the data available to multiple secondary processes without requiring regeneration or copying.

Cooperative Groups allows developers to express the granularity at which threads are communicating, helping them to express richer, more efficient parallel decompositions. Historically, the CUDA programming model has provided a single, simple construct for synchronizing cooperating threads: a barrier across all threads of a thread block, as implemented with the __syncthreads() intrinsic function. However, programmers would like to define and synchronize groups of threads at other granularities to enable greater performance, design flexibility, and software reuse in the form of \u201ccollective\u201d group-wide function interfaces. In an effort to express broader patterns of parallel interaction, many performance-oriented programmers have resorted to writing their own ad hoc and unsafe primitives for synchronizing threads within a single warp, or across sets of thread blocks running on a single GPU. Whilst the performance improvements achieved have often been valuable, this has resulted in an ever-growing collection of brittle code that is expensive to write, tune, and maintain over time and across GPU generations.

Introduced in CUDA 10.2, these APIs additionally provide a new way to interop with other processes and graphics APIs like OpenGL and Vulkan, as well as provide newer memory attributes that a user can tune to fit their applications. Historically, memory allocation calls (such as cudaMalloc() ) in the CUDA programming model have returned a memory address that points to the GPU memory. The address thus obtained could be used with any CUDA API or inside a device kernel. However, the memory allocated could not be resized depending on the user\u2019s memory needs. In order to increase an allocation\u2019s size, the user had to explicitly allocate a larger buffer, copy data from the initial allocation, free it and then continue to keep track of the newer allocation\u2019s address. This often leads to lower performance and higher peak memory utilization for applications. Essentially, users had a malloc-like interface for allocating GPU memory, but did not have a corresponding realloc to complement it. The Virtual Memory Management APIs decouple the idea of an address and memory and allow the application to handle them separately. The APIs allow applications to map and unmap memory from a virtual address range as they see fit. In the case of enabling peer device access to memory allocations by using cudaEnablePeerAccess , all past and future user allocations are mapped to the target peer device. This lead to users unwittingly paying runtime cost of mapping all cudaMalloc allocations to peer devices. However, in most situations applications communicate by sharing only a few allocations with another device and not all allocations are required to be mapped to all the devices. With Virtual Memory Management, applications can specifically choose certain allocations to be accessible from target devices. The CUDA Virtual Memory Management APIs expose fine grained control to the user for managing the GPU memory in applications. It provides APIs that let users: Place memory allocated on different devices into a contiguous VA range. Perform interprocess communication for memory sharing using platform-specific mechanisms. Opt into newer memory types on the devices that support them. In order to allocate memory, the Virtual Memory Management programming model exposes the following functionality: Allocating physical memory. Reserving a VA range.

L2 persistence can also be set for a CUDA Graph Kernel Node as shown in the example below: CUDA GraphKernelNode Example cudaKernelNodeAttrValue node_attribute; // Kernel level attributes data structure node_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.base_ptr = reinterpret_cast&lt;void*&gt;(ptr); // Global Memory data pointer node_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.num_bytes = num_bytes; // Number of bytes for persistence access. // (Must be less than cudaDeviceProp::accessPolicyMaxWindowSize) node_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.hitRatio = 0.6; // Hint for cache hit ratio node_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.hitProp = cudaAccessPropertyPersisting; // Type of access property on cache hit node_attribute.accessPolicyWindow.missProp = cudaAccessPropertyStreaming; // Type of access property on cache miss. //Set the attributes to a CUDA Graph Kernel node of type cudaGraphNode_t cudaGraphKernelNodeSetAttribute(node, cudaKernelNodeAttributeAccessPolicyWindow, &amp;node_attribute); The hitRatio parameter can be used to specify the fraction of accesses that receive the hitProp property. In both of the examples above, 60% of the memory accesses in the global memory region [ptr..ptr+num_bytes) have the persisting property and 40% of the memory accesses have the streaming property. Which specific memory accesses are classified as persisting (the hitProp ) is random with a probability of approximately hitRatio ; the probability distribution depends upon the hardware architecture and the memory extent. For example, if the L2 set-aside cache size is 16KB and the num_bytes in the accessPolicyWindow is 32KB: With a hitRatio of 0.5, the hardware will select, at random, 16KB of the 32KB window to be designated as persisting and cached in the set-aside L2 cache area. With a hitRatio of 1.0, the hardware will attempt to cache the whole 32KB window in the set-aside L2 cache area. Since the set-aside area is smaller than the window, cache lines will be evicted to keep the most recently used 16KB of the 32KB data in the set-aside portion of the L2 cache. The hitRatio can therefore be used to avoid thrashing of cache lines and overall reduce the amount of data moved into and out of the L2 cache. A hitRatio value below 1.0 can be used to manually control the amount of data different accessPolicyWindow s from concurrent CUDA streams can cache in L2. For example, let the L2 set-aside cache size be 16KB; two concurrent kernels in two different CUDA streams, each with a 16KB accessPolicyWindow , and both with hitRatio value 1.0, might evict each others\u2019 cache lines when competing for the shared L2 resource.

The innermost function scope enclosing the closure type is computed, and the corresponding function\u2019s execution space specifiers are assigned to the closure class member functions. If there is no enclosing function scope, the execution space specifier is __host__ .

Therefore, the compiler uses heuristics to minimize register usage while keeping register spilling (see Device Memory Accesses ) and instruction count to a minimum. An application can optionally aid these heuristics by providing additional information to the compiler in the form of launch bounds that are specified using the __launch_bounds__() qualifier in the definition of a __global__ function: __global__ void __launch_bounds__(maxThreadsPerBlock, minBlocksPerMultiprocessor, maxBlocksPerCluster) MyKernel(...) { ... } maxThreadsPerBlock specifies the maximum number of threads per block with which the application will ever launch MyKernel() ; it compiles to the .maxntid  PTX directive. minBlocksPerMultiprocessor is optional and specifies the desired minimum number of resident blocks per multiprocessor; it compiles to the .minnctapersm  PTX directive. maxBlocksPerCluster is optional and specifies the desired maximum number thread blocks per cluster with which the application will ever launch MyKernel() ; it compiles to the .maxclusterrank  PTX directive. If launch bounds are specified, the compiler first derives from them the upper limit L on the number of registers the kernel should use to ensure that minBlocksPerMultiprocessor blocks (or a single block if minBlocksPerMultiprocessor is not specified) of maxThreadsPerBlock threads can reside on the multiprocessor (see Hardware Multithreading for the relationship between the number of registers used by a kernel and the number of registers allocated per block). The compiler then optimizes register usage in the following way: If the initial register usage is higher than L , the compiler reduces it further until it becomes less or equal to L , usually at the expense of more local memory usage and/or higher number of instructions; If the initial register usage is lower than L If maxThreadsPerBlock is specified and minBlocksPerMultiprocessor is not, the compiler uses maxThreadsPerBlock to determine the register usage thresholds for the transitions between n and n+1 resident blocks (i.e., when using one less register makes room for an additional resident block as in the example of Multiprocessor Level ) and then applies similar heuristics as when no launch bounds are specified; If both minBlocksPerMultiprocessor and maxThreadsPerBlock are specified, the compiler may increase register usage as high as L to reduce the number of instructions and better hide single thread instruction latency. A kernel will fail to launch if it is executed with more threads per block than its launch bound maxThreadsPerBlock . A kernel will fail to launch if it is executed with more thread blocks per cluster than its launch bound maxBlocksPerCluster . Per thread resources required by a CUDA kernel might limit the maximum block size in an unwanted way. In order to maintain forward compatibility to future hardware and toolkits and to ensure that at least one thread block can run on an SM, developers should include the single argument __launch_bounds__(maxThreadsPerBlock) which specifies the largest block size that the kernel will be launched with. Failure to do so could lead to \u201ctoo many resources requested for launch\u201d errors. Providing the two argument version of __launch_bounds__(maxThreadsPerBlock,minBlocksPerMultiprocessor) can improve performance in some cases. The right value for minBlocksPerMultiprocessor should be determined using a detailed per kernel analysis. Optimal launch bounds for a given kernel will usually differ across major architecture revisions. The sample code below shows how this is typically handled in device code using the __CUDA_ARCH__ macro introduced in Application Compatibility #define THREADS_PER_BLOCK 256 #if __CUDA_ARCH__ &gt;= 200 #define MY_KERNEL_MAX_THREADS (2 * THREADS_PER_BLOCK) #define MY_KERNEL_MIN_BLOCKS 3 #else #define MY_KERNEL_MAX_THREADS THREADS_PER_BLOCK #define MY_KERNEL_MIN_BLOCKS 2 #endif // Device code __global__ void __launch_bounds__(MY_KERNEL_MAX_THREADS, MY_KERNEL_MIN_BLOCKS) MyKernel(...) { ... } In the common case where MyKernel is invoked with the maximum number of threads per block (specified as the first parameter of __launch_bounds__() ), it is tempting to use MY_KERNEL_MAX_THREADS as the number of threads per block in the execution configuration: // Host code MyKernel&lt;&lt;&lt;blocksPerGrid, MY_KERNEL_MAX_THREADS&gt;&gt;&gt;(...); This will not work however since __CUDA_ARCH__ is undefined in host code as mentioned in Application Compatibility , so MyKernel will launch with 256 threads per block even when __CUDA_ARCH__ is greater or equal to 200. Instead the number of threads per block should be determined: Either at compile time using a macro that does not depend on __CUDA_ARCH__ , for example // Host code MyKernel&lt;&lt;&lt;blocksPerGrid, THREADS_PER_BLOCK&gt;&gt;&gt;(...); Or at runtime based on the compute capability // Host code cudaGetDeviceProperties(&amp;deviceProp, device); int threadsPerBlock = (deviceProp.major &gt;= 2 ? 2 * THREADS_PER_BLOCK : THREADS_PER_BLOCK); MyKernel&lt;&lt;&lt;blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock&gt;&gt;&gt;(...); Register usage is reported by the --ptxas-options=-v compiler option. The number of resident blocks can be derived from the occupancy reported by the CUDA profiler (see Device Memory Accesses for a definition of occupancy). The __launch_bounds__() and __maxnreg__() qualifiers cannot be applied to the same kernel.

The printf() command can accept at most 32 arguments in addition to the format string. Additional arguments beyond this will be ignored, and the format specifier output as-is. Owing to the differing size of the long type on 64-bit Windows platforms (four bytes on 64-bit Windows platforms, eight bytes on other 64-bit platforms), a kernel which is compiled on a non-Windows 64-bit machine but then run on a win64 machine will see corrupted output for all format strings which include \u201c %ld \u201d. It is recommended that the compilation platform matches the execution platform to ensure safety. The output buffer for printf() is set to a fixed size before kernel launch (see Associated Host-Side API ). It is circular and if more output is produced during kernel execution than can fit in the buffer, older output is overwritten. It is flushed only when one of these actions is performed: Kernel launch via &lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or cuLaunchKernel() (at the start of the launch, and if the CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING environment variable is set to 1, at the end of the launch as well), Synchronization via cudaDeviceSynchronize() , cuCtxSynchronize() , cudaStreamSynchronize() , cuStreamSynchronize() , cudaEventSynchronize() , or cuEventSynchronize() , Memory copies via any blocking version of cudaMemcpy*() or cuMemcpy*() , Module loading/unloading via cuModuleLoad() or cuModuleUnload() , Context destruction via cudaDeviceReset() or cuCtxDestroy() . Prior to executing a stream callback added by cudaStreamAddCallback or cuStreamAddCallback . Note that the buffer is not flushed automatically when the program exits. The user must call cudaDeviceReset() or cuCtxDestroy() explicitly, as shown in the examples below. Internally printf() uses a shared data structure and so it is possible that calling printf() might change the order of execution of threads. In particular, a thread which calls printf() might take a longer execution path than one which does not call printf() , and that path length is dependent upon the parameters of the printf() . Note, however, that CUDA makes no guarantees of thread execution order except at explicit __syncthreads() barriers, so it is impossible to tell whether execution order has been modified by printf() or by other scheduling behavior in the hardware.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 404, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#linear-filtering", "display_name": "Linear Filtering", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "linear-filtering", "priority": -1, "content": "In this filtering mode, which is only available for floating-point textures, the value returned by the texture fetch is tex(x)=(1-\\alpha)T[i]+{\\alpha}T[i+1] for a one-dimensional texture, tex(x)=(1-\\alpha)T[i]+{\\alpha}T[i+1] for a one-dimensional texture, tex(x,y)=(1-\\alpha)(1-\\beta)T[i,j]+\\alpha(1-\\beta)T[i+1,j]+(1-\\alpha){\\beta}T[i,j+1]+\\alpha{\\beta}T[i+1,j+1] for a two-dimensional texture, tex(x,y,z) = (1-\\alpha)(1-\\beta)(1-\\gamma)T[i,j,k]+\\alpha(1-\\beta)(1-\\gamma)T[i+1,j,k]+ (1-\\alpha)\\beta(1-\\gamma)T[i,j+1,k]+\\alpha\\beta(1-\\gamma)T[i+1,j+1,k]+ (1-\\alpha)(1-\\beta){\\gamma}T[i,j,k+1]+\\alpha(1-\\beta){\\gamma}T[i+1,j,k+1]+ (1-\\alpha)\\beta{\\gamma}T[i,j+1,k+1]+\\alpha\\beta{\\gamma}T[i+1,j+1,k+1] for a three-dimensional texture, where: i=floor(x\\ B)*, \\alpha=frac(x\\ B)*, *x\\ B\\ =x-0.5, j=floor(y\\ B)*, \\beta=frac(y\\ B)*, *y\\ B\\ =y-0.5, k=floor(z\\ B)*, \\gamma=frac(z\\ B)*, *z\\ B\\ = z-0.5, \\alpha , \\beta , and \\gamma are stored in 9-bit fixed point format with 8 bits of fractional value (so 1.0 is exactly represented).

Here we present a system for finer-grained control of managed memory designed to work on all devices supporting managed memory, including older architectures with concurrentManagedAccess equal to 0. The CUDA programming model provides streams as a mechanism for programs to indicate dependence and independence among kernel launches. Kernels launched into the same stream are guaranteed to execute consecutively, while kernels launched into different streams are permitted to execute concurrently. Streams describe independence between work items and hence allow potentially greater efficiency through concurrency. Unified Memory builds upon the stream-independence model by allowing a CUDA program to explicitly associate managed allocations with a CUDA stream. In this way, the programmer indicates the use of data by kernels based on whether they are launched into a specified stream or not. This enables opportunities for concurrency based on program-specific data access patterns. The function to control this behavior is: cudaError_t cudaStreamAttachMemAsync(cudaStream_t stream, void *ptr, size_t length=0, unsigned int flags=0); The cudaStreamAttachMemAsync() function associates length bytes of memory starting from ptr with the specified stream . (Currently, length must always be 0 to indicate that the entire region should be attached.) Because of this association, the Unified Memory system allows CPU access to this memory region so long as all operations in stream have completed, regardless of whether other streams are active. In effect, this constrains exclusive ownership of the managed memory region by an active GPU to per-stream activity instead of whole-GPU activity. Most importantly, if an allocation is not associated with a specific stream, it is visible to all running kernels regardless of their stream. This is the default visibility for a cudaMallocManaged() allocation or a __managed__ variable; hence, the simple-case rule that the CPU may not touch the data while any kernel is running. By associating an allocation with a specific stream, the program makes a guarantee that only kernels launched into that stream will touch that data. No error checking is performed by the Unified Memory system: it is the programmer\u2019s responsibility to ensure that guarantee is honored. In addition to allowing greater concurrency, the use of cudaStreamAttachMemAsync() can (and typically does) enable data transfer optimizations within the Unified Memory system that may affect latencies and other overhead.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 415, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#mapped-memory", "display_name": "Mapped Memory", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "mapped-memory", "priority": -1, "content": "A block of page-locked host memory can also be mapped into the address space of the device by passing flag cudaHostAllocMapped to cudaHostAlloc() or by passing flag cudaHostRegisterMapped to cudaHostRegister() . Such a block has therefore in general two addresses: one in host memory that is returned by cudaHostAlloc() or malloc() , and one in device memory that can be retrieved using cudaHostGetDevicePointer() and then used to access the block from within a kernel. The only exception is for pointers allocated with cudaHostAlloc() and when a unified address space is used for the host and the device as mentioned in Unified Virtual Address Space . Accessing host memory directly from within a kernel does not provide the same bandwidth as device memory, but does have some advantages: There is no need to allocate a block in device memory and copy data between this block and the block in host memory; data transfers are implicitly performed as needed by the kernel; There is no need to use streams (see Concurrent Data Transfers ) to overlap data transfers with kernel execution; the kernel-originated data transfers automatically overlap with kernel execution. Since mapped page-locked memory is shared between host and device however, the application must synchronize memory accesses using streams or events (see Asynchronous Concurrent Execution ) to avoid any potential read-after-write, write-after-read, or write-after-write hazards. To be able to retrieve the device pointer to any mapped page-locked memory, page-locked memory mapping must be enabled by calling cudaSetDeviceFlags() with the cudaDeviceMapHost flag before any other CUDA call is performed. Otherwise, cudaHostGetDevicePointer() will return an error. cudaHostGetDevicePointer() also returns an error if the device does not support mapped page-locked host memory. Applications may query this capability by checking the canMapHostMemory device property (see Device Enumeration ), which is equal to 1 for devices that support mapped page-locked host memory. Note that atomic functions (see Atomic Functions ) operating on mapped page-locked memory are not atomic from the point of view of the host or other devices. Also note that CUDA runtime requires that 1-byte, 2-byte, 4-byte, and 8-byte naturally aligned loads and stores to host memory initiated from the device are preserved as single accesses from the point of view of the host and other devices. On some platforms, atomics to memory may be broken by the hardware into separate load and store operations. These component load and store operations have the same requirements on preservation of naturally aligned accesses. As an example, the CUDA runtime does not support a PCI Express bus topology where a PCI Express bridge splits 8-byte naturally aligned writes into two 4-byte writes between the device and the host.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 416, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#mapping-buffers-onto-imported-memory-objects", "display_name": "Mapping Buffers onto Imported Memory Objects", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "mapping-buffers-onto-imported-memory-objects", "priority": -1, "content": "A device pointer can be mapped onto an imported memory object as shown below.

That means minimizing data transfers between the host and the device, as detailed in Data Transfer between Host and Device , since these have much lower bandwidth than data transfers between global memory and the device. That also means minimizing data transfers between global memory and the device by maximizing use of on-chip memory: shared memory and caches (i.e., L1 cache and L2 cache available on devices of compute capability 2.x and higher, texture cache and constant cache available on all devices). Shared memory is equivalent to a user-managed cache: The application explicitly allocates and accesses it. As illustrated in CUDA Runtime , a typical programming pattern is to stage data coming from device memory into shared memory; in other words, to have each thread of a block: Load data from device memory to shared memory, Synchronize with all the other threads of the block so that each thread can safely read shared memory locations that were populated by different threads, Process the data in shared memory, Synchronize again if necessary to make sure that shared memory has been updated with the results, Write the results back to device memory. For some applications (for example, for which global memory access patterns are data-dependent), a traditional hardware-managed cache is more appropriate to exploit data locality. As mentioned in Compute Capability 7.x , Compute Capability 8.x and Compute Capability 9.0 , for devices of compute capability 7.x, 8.x and 9.0, the same on-chip memory is used for both L1 and shared memory, and how much of it is dedicated to L1 versus shared memory is configurable for each kernel call. The throughput of memory accesses by a kernel can vary by an order of magnitude depending on access pattern for each type of memory. The next step in maximizing memory throughput is therefore to organize memory accesses as optimally as possible based on the optimal memory access patterns described in Device Memory Accesses . This optimization is especially important for global memory accesses as global memory bandwidth is low compared to available on-chip bandwidths and arithmetic instruction throughput, so non-optimal global memory accesses generally have a high impact on performance.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 432, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#maximize-utilization", "display_name": "Maximize Utilization", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "maximize-utilization", "priority": -1, "content": "To maximize utilization the application should be structured in a way that it exposes as much parallelism as possible and efficiently maps this parallelism to the various components of the system to keep them busy most of the time.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 433, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#maximum-number-of-registers-per-thread", "display_name": "Maximum Number of Registers per Thread", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "maximum-number-of-registers-per-thread", "priority": -1, "content": "To provide a mechanism for low-level performance tuning, CUDA C++ provides the __maxnreg__() function qualifier to pass performance tuning information to the backend optimizing compiler.

Given a set of threads named in the group, memcpy_async will move specified amount of bytes or elements of the input type through a single pipeline stage. Additionally for achieving best performance when using the memcpy_async API, an alignment of 16 bytes for both shared memory and global memory is required. It is important to note that while this is a memcpy in the general case, it is only asynchronous if the source is global memory and the destination is shared memory and both can be addressed with 16, 8, or 4 byte alignments. Asynchronously copied data should only be read following a call to wait or wait_prior which signals that the corresponding stage has completed moving data to shared memory. Having to wait on all outstanding requests can lose some flexibility (but gain simplicity). In order to efficiently overlap data transfer and execution, its important to be able to kick off an N+1  memcpy_async request while waiting on and operating on request N . To do so, use memcpy_async and wait on it using the collective stage-based wait_prior API. See wait and wait_prior for more details.

Errata The memcpy_async API introduced in CUDA 11.1 with both src and dst input layouts, expects the layout to be provided in elements rather than bytes. The element type is inferred from TyElem and has the size sizeof(TyElem) . If cuda::aligned_size_t&lt;N&gt; type is used as the layout, the number of elements specified times sizeof(TyElem) must be a multiple of N and it is recommended to use std::byte or char as the element type. If specified shape or layout of the copy is of type cuda::aligned_size_t&lt;N&gt; , alignment will be guaranteed to be at least min(16, N) .

It is undefined behavior for two threads to read from or write to the same memory location without synchronization. In the following example, thread 1 executes writeXY() , while thread 2 executes readXY() . __device__ int X = 1, Y = 2; __device__ void writeXY() { X = 10; Y = 20; } __device__ void readXY() { int B = Y; int A = X; } The two threads read and write from the same memory locations X and Y simultaneously. Any data-race is undefined behavior, and has no defined semantics. The resulting values for A and B can be anything. Memory fence functions can be used to enforce a sequentially-consistent ordering on memory accesses. The memory fence functions differ in the scope in which the orderings are enforced but they are independent of the accessed memory space (shared memory, global memory, page-locked host memory, and the memory of a peer device). void __threadfence_block(); is equivalent to cuda::atomic_thread_fence(cuda::memory_order_seq_cst, cuda::thread_scope_block) and ensures that: All writes to all memory made by the calling thread before the call to __threadfence_block() are observed by all threads in the block of the calling thread as occurring before all writes to all memory made by the calling thread after the call to __threadfence_block() ; All reads from all memory made by the calling thread before the call to __threadfence_block() are ordered before all reads from all memory made by the calling thread after the call to __threadfence_block() . void __threadfence(); is equivalent to cuda::atomic_thread_fence(cuda::memory_order_seq_cst, cuda::thread_scope_device) and ensures that no writes to all memory made by the calling thread after the call to __threadfence() are observed by any thread in the device as occurring before any write to all memory made by the calling thread before the call to __threadfence() . void __threadfence_system(); is equivalent to cuda::atomic_thread_fence(cuda::memory_order_seq_cst, cuda::thread_scope_system) and ensures that all writes to all memory made by the calling thread before the call to __threadfence_system() are observed by all threads in the device, host threads, and all threads in peer devices as occurring before all writes to all memory made by the calling thread after the call to __threadfence_system() . __threadfence_system() is only supported by devices of compute capability 2.x and higher. In the previous code sample, we can insert fences in the codes as follows: __device__ int X = 1, Y = 2; __device__ void writeXY() { X = 10; __threadfence(); Y = 20; } __device__ void readXY() { int B = Y; __threadfence(); int A = X; } For this code, the following outcomes can be observed: A equal to 1 and B equal to 2, A equal to 10 and B equal to 2, A equal to 10 and B equal to 20. The fourth outcome is not possible, because the first write must be visible before the second write. If thread 1 and 2 belong to the same block, it is enough to use __threadfence_block() . If thread 1 and 2 do not belong to the same block, __threadfence() must be used if they are CUDA threads from the same device and __threadfence_system() must be used if they are CUDA threads from two different devices. A common use case is when threads consume some data produced by other threads as illustrated by the following code sample of a kernel that computes the sum of an array of N numbers in one call. Each block first sums a subset of the array and stores the result in global memory. When all blocks are done, the last block done reads each of these partial sums from global memory and sums them to obtain the final result. In order to determine which block is finished last, each block atomically increments a counter to signal that it is done with computing and storing its partial sum (see Atomic Functions about atomic functions). The last block is the one that receives the counter value equal to gridDim.x-1 . If no fence is placed between storing the partial sum and incrementing the counter, the counter might increment before the partial sum is stored and therefore, might reach gridDim.x-1 and let the last block start reading partial sums before they have been actually updated in memory. Memory fence functions only affect the ordering of memory operations by a thread; they do not, by themselves, ensure that these memory operations are visible to other threads (like __syncthreads() does for threads within a block (see Synchronization Functions )). In the code sample below, the visibility of memory operations on the result variable is ensured by declaring it as volatile (see Volatile Qualifier ). __device__ unsigned int count = 0; __shared__ bool isLastBlockDone; __global__ void sum(const float* array, unsigned int N, volatile float* result) { // Each block sums a subset of the input array. float partialSum = calculatePartialSum(array, N); if (threadIdx.x == 0) { // Thread 0 of each block stores the partial sum // to global memory. The compiler will use // a store operation that bypasses the L1 cache // since the &quot;result&quot; variable is declared as // volatile. This ensures that the threads of // the last block will read the correct partial // sums computed by all other blocks. result[blockIdx.x] = partialSum; // Thread 0 makes sure that the incrementing // of the &quot;count&quot; variable is only performed after // the partial sum has been written to global memory. __threadfence(); // Thread 0 signals that it is done. unsigned int value = atomicInc(&amp;count, gridDim.x); // Thread 0 determines if its block is the last // block to be done. isLastBlockDone = (value == (gridDim.x - 1)); } // Synchronize to make sure that each thread reads // the correct value of isLastBlockDone. __syncthreads(); if (isLastBlockDone) { // The last block sums the partial sums // stored in result[0 .. gridDim.x-1] float totalSum = calculateTotalSum(result); if (threadIdx.x == 0) { // Thread 0 of last block stores the total sum // to global memory and resets the count // variable, so that the next kernel call // works properly. result[0] = totalSum; count = 0; } } }", "keywords": []}, {"id": 445, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#memory-fence-interference", "display_name": "Memory Fence Interference", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "memory-fence-interference", "priority": -1, "content": "Some CUDA applications may see degraded performance due to memory fence/flush operations waiting on more transactions than those necessitated by the CUDA memory consistency model. __managed__ int x = 0; __device__ cuda::atomic&lt;int, cuda::thread_scope_device&gt; a(0); __managed__ cuda::atomic&lt;int, cuda::thread_scope_system&gt; b(0); Thread 1 (SM) x = 1; a = 1; Thread 2 (SM) while (a != 1) ; assert(x == 1); b = 1; Thread 3 (CPU) while (b != 1) ; assert(x == 1); Consider the example above.

The system-scope ordering provided by release and acquire of b , therefore, needs to ensure not only writes issued from thread 2 itself are visible to thread 3, but also writes from other threads that are visible to thread 2. This is known as cumulativity. As the GPU cannot know at the time of execution which writes have been guaranteed at the source level to be visible and which are visible only by chance timing, it must cast a conservatively wide net for in-flight memory operations. This sometimes leads to interference: because the GPU is waiting on memory operations it is not required to at the source level, the fence/flush may take longer than necessary. Note that fences may occur explicitly as intrinsics or atomics in code, like in the example, or implicitly to implement synchronizes-with relationships at task boundaries. A common example is when a kernel is performing computation in local GPU memory, and a parallel kernel (e.g. from NCCL) is performing communications with a peer. Upon completion, the local kernel will implicitly flush its writes to satisfy any synchronizes-with relationships to downstream work. This may unnecessarily wait, fully or partially, on slower nvlink or PCIe writes from the communication kernel.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 446, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#memory-footprint", "display_name": "Memory Footprint", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "memory-footprint", "priority": -1, "content": "The device runtime system software reserves memory for various management purposes, in particular a reservation for tracking pending grid launches.

This section attempts to define all necessary terms and explain why paging matters for performance. All currently supported systems for Unified Memory use a virtual address space: this means that memory addresses used by an application represent a virtual location which might be mapped to a physical location where the memory actually resides. All currently supported processors, including both CPUs and GPUs, additionally use memory paging . Because all systems use a virtual address space, there are two types of memory pages: Virtual pages: this represents a fixed-size contiguous chunk of virtual memory per process tracked by the operating system, which can be mapped into physical memory. Note that the virtual page is linked to the mapping : for example, a single virtual address might be mapped into physical memory using different page sizes. Physical pages: this represents a fixed-size contiguous chunk of memory the processor\u2019s main Memory Management Unit (MMU) supports and into which a virtual page can be mapped. Currently, all x86_64 CPUs use 4KiB physical pages. Arm CPUs support multiple physical page sizes - 4KiB, 16KiB, 32KiB and 64KiB - depending on the exact CPU. Finally, NVIDIA GPUs support multiple physical page sizes, but prefer 2MiB physical pages or larger. Note that these sizes are subject to change in future hardware. The default page size of virtual pages usually corresponds to the physical page size, but an application may use different page sizes as long as they are supported by the operating system and the hardware. Typically, supported virtual page sizes must be powers of 2 and multiples of the physical page size. The logical entity tracking the mapping of virtual pages into physical pages will be referred to as a page table , and each mapping of a given virtual page with a given virtual size to physical pages is called a page table entry (PTE) . All supported processors provide specific caches for the page table to speed up the translation of virtual addresses to physical addresses. These caches are called translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) . There are two important aspects for performance tuning of applications: the choice of virtual page size, whether the system offers a combined page table used by both CPUs and GPUs, or separate page tables for each CPU and GPU individually.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 452, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#memory-pools-and-the-cudamempool-t", "display_name": "Memory Pools and the cudaMemPool_t", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "memory-pools-and-the-cudamempool-t", "priority": -1, "content": "Memory pools encapsulate virtual address and physical memory resources that are allocated and managed according to the pools attributes and properties.

This, a significant departure from existing CUDA APIs, will allow a single host thread to launch a kernel across multiple devices.

The functions launched via this API must be identical. No explicit checks are done by the driver in this regard because it is largely not feasible. It is up to the application to ensure this. No two entries in the provided cudaLaunchParams may map to the same device. All devices being targeted by this launch must be of the same compute capability - major and minor versions. The block size, grid size and amount of shared memory per grid must be the same across all devices. Note that this means the maximum number of blocks that can be launched per device will be limited by the device with the least number of SMs. Any user defined __device__ , __constant__ or __managed__ device global variables present in the module that owns the CUfunction being launched are independently instantiated on every device. The user is responsible for initializing such device global variables appropriately. Deprecation Notice: cudaLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice has been deprecated in CUDA 11.3 for all devices. Example of an alternative approach can be found in the multi device conjugate gradient sample. Optimal performance in multi-device synchronization is achieved by enabling peer access via cuCtxEnablePeerAccess or cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess for all participating devices. The launch parameters should be defined using an array of structs (one per device), and launched with cudaLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice Example: cudaDeviceProp deviceProp; cudaGetDeviceCount(&amp;numGpus); // Per device launch parameters cudaLaunchParams *launchParams = (cudaLaunchParams*)malloc(sizeof(cudaLaunchParams) * numGpus); cudaStream_t *streams = (cudaStream_t*)malloc(sizeof(cudaStream_t) * numGpus); // The kernel arguments are copied over during launch // Its also possible to have individual copies of kernel arguments per device, but // the signature and name of the function/kernel must be the same. void *kernelArgs[] = { /* Add kernel arguments */ }; for (int i = 0; i &lt; numGpus; i++) { cudaSetDevice(i); // Per device stream, but its also possible to use the default NULL stream of each device cudaStreamCreate(&amp;streams[i]); // Loop over other devices and cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess to get a faster barrier implementation } // Since all devices must be of the same compute capability and have the same launch configuration // it is sufficient to query device 0 here cudaGetDeviceProperties(&amp;deviceProp[i], 0); dim3 dimBlock(numThreads, 1, 1); dim3 dimGrid(deviceProp.multiProcessorCount, 1, 1); for (int i = 0; i &lt; numGpus; i++) { launchParamsList[i].func = (void*)my_kernel; launchParamsList[i].gridDim = dimGrid; launchParamsList[i].blockDim = dimBlock; launchParamsList[i].sharedMem = 0; launchParamsList[i].stream = streams[i]; launchParamsList[i].args = kernelArgs; } cudaLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice(launchParams, numGpus); Also, as with grid-wide synchronization, the resulting device code looks very similar: multi_grid_group multi_grid = this_multi_grid(); multi_grid.sync(); However, the code needs to be compiled in separate compilation by passing -rdc=true to nvcc.

It provides a mechanism for managing a sequence of memcpy_async batches, enabling CUDA kernels to overlap memory transfers with computation. The following example implements a two-stage pipeline that overlaps data-transfer with computation. It: Initializes the pipeline shared state (more below) Kickstarts the pipeline by scheduling a memcpy_async for the first batch. Loops over all the batches: it schedules memcpy_async for the next batch, blocks all threads on the completion of the memcpy_async for the previous batch, and then overlaps the computation on the previous batch with the asynchronous copy of the memory for the next batch. Finally, it drains the pipeline by performing the computation on the last batch.

Producer threads commit work to the pipeline\u2019s head, while consumer threads pull work from the pipeline\u2019s tail. In the example above, all threads are both producer and consumer threads. The threads first commit  memcpy_async operations to fetch the next batch while they wait on the previous batch of memcpy_async operations to complete. Committing work to a pipeline stage involves: Collectively acquiring the pipeline head from a set of producer threads using pipeline.producer_acquire() . Submitting memcpy_async operations to the pipeline head. Collectively commiting (advancing) the pipeline head using pipeline.producer_commit() . Using a previously commited stage involves: Collectively waiting for the stage to complete, e.g., using pipeline.consumer_wait() to wait on the tail (oldest) stage. Collectively releasing the stage using pipeline.consumer_release() . cuda::pipeline_shared_state&lt;scope, count&gt; encapsulates the finite resources that allow a pipeline to process up to count concurrent stages. If all resources are in use, pipeline.producer_acquire() blocks producer threads until the resources of the next pipeline stage are released by consumer threads. This example can be written in a more concise manner by merging the prolog and epilog of the loop with the loop itself as follows: template &lt;size_t stages_count = 2 /* Pipeline with stages_count stages */&gt; __global__ void with_staging_unified(int* global_out, int const* global_in, size_t size, size_t batch_sz) { auto grid = cooperative_groups::this_grid(); auto block = cooperative_groups::this_thread_block(); assert(size == batch_sz * grid.size()); // Assume input size fits batch_sz * grid_size extern __shared__ int shared[]; // stages_count * block.size() * sizeof(int) bytes size_t shared_offset[stages_count]; for (int s = 0; s &lt; stages_count; ++s) shared_offset[s] = s * block.size(); __shared__ cuda::pipeline_shared_state&lt; cuda::thread_scope::thread_scope_block, stages_count &gt; shared_state; auto pipeline = cuda::make_pipeline(block, &amp;shared_state); auto block_batch = [&amp;](size_t batch) -&gt; int { return block.group_index().x * block.size() + grid.size() * batch; }; // compute_batch: next batch to process // fetch_batch: next batch to fetch from global memory for (size_t compute_batch = 0, fetch_batch = 0; compute_batch &lt; batch_sz; ++compute_batch) { // The outer loop iterates over the computation of the batches for (; fetch_batch &lt; batch_sz &amp;&amp; fetch_batch &lt; (compute_batch + stages_count); ++fetch_batch) { // This inner loop iterates over the memory transfers, making sure that the pipeline is always full pipeline.producer_acquire(); size_t shared_idx = fetch_batch % stages_count; size_t batch_idx = fetch_batch; size_t block_batch_idx = block_batch(batch_idx); cuda::memcpy_async(block, shared + shared_offset[shared_idx], global_in + block_batch_idx, sizeof(int) * block.size(), pipeline); pipeline.producer_commit(); } pipeline.consumer_wait(); int shared_idx = compute_batch % stages_count; int batch_idx = compute_batch; compute(global_out + block_batch(batch_idx), shared + shared_offset[shared_idx]); pipeline.consumer_release(); } } The pipeline&lt;thread_scope_block&gt; primitive used above is very flexible, and supports two features that our examples above are not using: any arbitrary subset of threads in the block can participate in the pipeline , and from the threads that participate, any subsets can be producers, consumers, or both. In the following example, threads with an \u201ceven\u201d thread rank are producers, while other threads are consumers: __device__ void compute(int* global_out, int shared_in); template &lt;size_t stages_count = 2&gt; __global__ void with_specialized_staging_unified(int* global_out, int const* global_in, size_t size, size_t batch_sz) { auto grid = cooperative_groups::this_grid(); auto block = cooperative_groups::this_thread_block(); // In this example, threads with &quot;even&quot; thread rank are producers, while threads with &quot;odd&quot; thread rank are consumers: const cuda::pipeline_role thread_role = block.thread_rank() % 2 == 0? cuda::pipeline_role::producer : cuda::pipeline_role::consumer; // Each thread block only has half of its threads as producers: auto producer_threads = block.size() / 2; // Map adjacent even and odd threads to the same id: const int thread_idx = block.thread_rank() / 2; auto elements_per_batch = size / batch_sz; auto elements_per_batch_per_block = elements_per_batch / grid.group_dim().x; extern __shared__ int shared[]; // stages_count * elements_per_batch_per_block * sizeof(int) bytes size_t shared_offset[stages_count]; for (int s = 0; s &lt; stages_count; ++s) shared_offset[s] = s * elements_per_batch_per_block; __shared__ cuda::pipeline_shared_state&lt; cuda::thread_scope::thread_scope_block, stages_count &gt; shared_state; cuda::pipeline pipeline = cuda::make_pipeline(block, &amp;shared_state, thread_role); // Each thread block processes `batch_sz` batches. // Compute offset of the batch `batch` of this thread block in global memory: auto block_batch = [&amp;](size_t batch) -&gt; int { return elements_per_batch * batch + elements_per_batch_per_block * blockIdx.x; }; for (size_t compute_batch = 0, fetch_batch = 0; compute_batch &lt; batch_sz; ++compute_batch) { // The outer loop iterates over the computation of the batches for (; fetch_batch &lt; batch_sz &amp;&amp; fetch_batch &lt; (compute_batch + stages_count); ++fetch_batch) { // This inner loop iterates over the memory transfers, making sure that the pipeline is always full if (thread_role == cuda::pipeline_role::producer) { // Only the producer threads schedule asynchronous memcpys: pipeline.producer_acquire(); size_t shared_idx = fetch_batch % stages_count; size_t batch_idx = fetch_batch; size_t global_batch_idx = block_batch(batch_idx) + thread_idx; size_t shared_batch_idx = shared_offset[shared_idx] + thread_idx; cuda::memcpy_async(shared + shared_batch_idx, global_in + global_batch_idx, sizeof(int), pipeline); pipeline.producer_commit(); } } if (thread_role == cuda::pipeline_role::consumer) { // Only the consumer threads compute: pipeline.consumer_wait(); size_t shared_idx = compute_batch % stages_count; size_t global_batch_idx = block_batch(compute_batch) + thread_idx; size_t shared_batch_idx = shared_offset[shared_idx] + thread_idx; compute(global_out + global_batch_idx, *(shared + shared_batch_idx)); pipeline.consumer_release(); } } } There are some optimizations that pipeline performs, for example, when all threads are both producers and consumers, but in general, the cost of supporting all these features cannot be fully eliminated. For example, pipeline stores and uses a set of barriers in shared memory for synchronization, which is not really necessary if all threads in the block participate in the pipeline. For the particular case in which all threads in the block participate in the pipeline , we can do better than pipeline&lt;thread_scope_block&gt; by using a pipeline&lt;thread_scope_thread&gt; combined with __syncthreads() : template&lt;size_t stages_count&gt; __global__ void with_staging_scope_thread(int* global_out, int const* global_in, size_t size, size_t batch_sz) { auto grid = cooperative_groups::this_grid(); auto block = cooperative_groups::this_thread_block(); auto thread = cooperative_groups::this_thread(); assert(size == batch_sz * grid.size()); // Assume input size fits batch_sz * grid_size extern __shared__ int shared[]; // stages_count * block.size() * sizeof(int) bytes size_t shared_offset[stages_count]; for (int s = 0; s &lt; stages_count; ++s) shared_offset[s] = s * block.size(); // No pipeline::shared_state needed cuda::pipeline&lt;cuda::thread_scope_thread&gt; pipeline = cuda::make_pipeline(); auto block_batch = [&amp;](size_t batch) -&gt; int { return block.group_index().x * block.size() + grid.size() * batch; }; for (size_t compute_batch = 0, fetch_batch = 0; compute_batch &lt; batch_sz; ++compute_batch) { for (; fetch_batch &lt; batch_sz &amp;&amp; fetch_batch &lt; (compute_batch + stages_count); ++fetch_batch) { pipeline.producer_acquire(); size_t shared_idx = fetch_batch % stages_count; size_t batch_idx = fetch_batch; // Each thread fetches its own data: size_t thread_batch_idx = block_batch(batch_idx) + threadIdx.x; // The copy is performed by a single `thread` and the size of the batch is now that of a single element: cuda::memcpy_async(thread, shared + shared_offset[shared_idx] + threadIdx.x, global_in + thread_batch_idx, sizeof(int), pipeline); pipeline.producer_commit(); } pipeline.consumer_wait(); block.sync(); // __syncthreads: All memcpy_async of all threads in the block for this stage have completed here int shared_idx = compute_batch % stages_count; int batch_idx = compute_batch; compute(global_out + block_batch(batch_idx), shared + shared_offset[shared_idx]); pipeline.consumer_release(); } } If the compute operation only reads shared memory written to by other threads in the same warp as the current thread, __syncwarp() suffices.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 464, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#multiprocessor-level", "display_name": "Multiprocessor Level", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "multiprocessor-level", "priority": -1, "content": "At an even lower level, the application should maximize parallel execution between the various functional units within a multiprocessor. As described in Hardware Multithreading , a GPU multiprocessor primarily relies on thread-level parallelism to maximize utilization of its functional units. Utilization is therefore directly linked to the number of resident warps. At every instruction issue time, a warp scheduler selects an instruction that is ready to execute. This instruction can be another independent instruction of the same warp, exploiting instruction-level parallelism, or more commonly an instruction of another warp, exploiting thread-level parallelism. If a ready to execute instruction is selected it is issued to the active threads of the warp. The number of clock cycles it takes for a warp to be ready to execute its next instruction is called the latency , and full utilization is achieved when all warp schedulers always have some instruction to issue for some warp at every clock cycle during that latency period, or in other words, when latency is completely \u201chidden\u201d. The number of instructions required to hide a latency of L clock cycles depends on the respective throughputs of these instructions (see Arithmetic Instructions for the throughputs of various arithmetic instructions). If we assume instructions with maximum throughput, it is equal to: 4L for devices of compute capability 5.x, 6.1, 6.2, 7.x and 8.x since for these devices, a multiprocessor issues one instruction per warp over one clock cycle for four warps at a time, as mentioned in Compute Capabilities . 2L for devices of compute capability 6.0 since for these devices, the two instructions issued every cycle are one instruction for two different warps. The most common reason a warp is not ready to execute its next instruction is that the instruction\u2019s input operands are not available yet. If all input operands are registers, latency is caused by register dependencies, i.e., some of the input operands are written by some previous instruction(s) whose execution has not completed yet. In this case, the latency is equal to the execution time of the previous instruction and the warp schedulers must schedule instructions of other warps during that time. Execution time varies depending on the instruction. On devices of compute capability 7.x, for most arithmetic instructions, it is typically 4 clock cycles. This means that 16 active warps per multiprocessor (4 cycles, 4 warp schedulers) are required to hide arithmetic instruction latencies (assuming that warps execute instructions with maximum throughput, otherwise fewer warps are needed). If the individual warps exhibit instruction-level parallelism, i.e. have multiple independent instructions in their instruction stream, fewer warps are needed because multiple independent instructions from a single warp can be issued back to back. If some input operand resides in off-chip memory, the latency is much higher: typically hundreds of clock cycles. The number of warps required to keep the warp schedulers busy during such high latency periods depends on the kernel code and its degree of instruction-level parallelism. In general, more warps are required if the ratio of the number of instructions with no off-chip memory operands (i.e., arithmetic instructions most of the time) to the number of instructions with off-chip memory operands is low (this ratio is commonly called the arithmetic intensity of the program). Another reason a warp is not ready to execute its next instruction is that it is waiting at some memory fence ( Memory Fence Functions ) or synchronization point ( Synchronization Functions ). A synchronization point can force the multiprocessor to idle as more and more warps wait for other warps in the same block to complete execution of instructions prior to the synchronization point. Having multiple resident blocks per multiprocessor can help reduce idling in this case, as warps from different blocks do not need to wait for each other at synchronization points. The number of blocks and warps residing on each multiprocessor for a given kernel call depends on the execution configuration of the call ( Execution Configuration ), the memory resources of the multiprocessor, and the resource requirements of the kernel as described in Hardware Multithreading . Register and shared memory usage are reported by the compiler when compiling with the --ptxas-options=-v option. The total amount of shared memory required for a block is equal to the sum of the amount of statically allocated shared memory and the amount of dynamically allocated shared memory. The number of registers used by a kernel can have a significant impact on the number of resident warps. For example, for devices of compute capability 6.x, if a kernel uses 64 registers and each block has 512 threads and requires very little shared memory, then two blocks (i.e., 32 warps) can reside on the multiprocessor since they require 2x512x64 registers, which exactly matches the number of registers available on the multiprocessor. But as soon as the kernel uses one more register, only one block (i.e., 16 warps) can be resident since two blocks would require 2x512x65 registers, which are more registers than are available on the multiprocessor. Therefore, the compiler attempts to minimize register usage while keeping register spilling (see Device Memory Accesses ) and the number of instructions to a minimum. Register usage can be controlled using the maxrregcount compiler option, the __launch_bounds__() qualifier as described in Launch Bounds , or the __maxnreg__() qualifier as described in Maximum Number of Registers per Thread . The register file is organized as 32-bit registers. So, each variable stored in a register needs at least one 32-bit register, for example, a double variable uses two 32-bit registers. The effect of execution configuration on performance for a given kernel call generally depends on the kernel code. Experimentation is therefore recommended. Applications can also parametrize execution configurations based on register file size and shared memory size, which depends on the compute capability of the device, as well as on the number of multiprocessors and memory bandwidth of the device, all of which can be queried using the runtime (see reference manual). The number of threads per block should be chosen as a multiple of the warp size to avoid wasting computing resources with under-populated warps as much as possible.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 465, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#namespace-reservations", "display_name": "Namespace Reservations", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "namespace-reservations", "priority": -1, "content": "Unless an exception is otherwise noted, it is undefined behavior to add any declarations or definitions to cuda:: , nv:: , cooperative_groups:: or any namespace nested within.

Using the device runtime, one kernel may launch another kernel, and that kernel may launch another, and so on. Each subordinate launch is considered a new nesting level , and the total number of levels is the nesting depth of the program. The synchronization depth is defined as the deepest level at which the program will explicitly synchronize on a child launch. Typically this is one less than the nesting depth of the program, but if the program does not need to call cudaDeviceSynchronize() at all levels then the synchronization depth might be substantially different to the nesting depth. Explicit synchronization with child kernels from a parent block (i.e. using cudaDeviceSynchronize() in device code) is deprecated in CUDA 11.6, removed for compute_90+ compilation, and is slated for full removal in a future CUDA release. The overall maximum nesting depth is limited to 24, but practically speaking the real limit will be the amount of memory required by the system for each new level (see Memory Footprint (CDP1) above). Any launch which would result in a kernel at a deeper level than the maximum will fail. Note that this may also apply to cudaMemcpyAsync() , which might itself generate a kernel launch. See Configuration Options (CDP1) for details. By default, sufficient storage is reserved for two levels of synchronization. This maximum synchronization depth (and hence reserved storage) may be controlled by calling cudaDeviceSetLimit() and specifying cudaLimitDevRuntimeSyncDepth . The number of levels to be supported must be configured before the top-level kernel is launched from the host, in order to guarantee successful execution of a nested program. Calling cudaDeviceSynchronize() at a depth greater than the specified maximum synchronization depth will return an error. An optimization is permitted where the system detects that it need not reserve space for the parent\u2019s state in cases where the parent kernel never calls cudaDeviceSynchronize() . In this case, because explicit parent/child synchronization never occurs, the memory footprint required for a program will be much less than the conservative maximum.

The occupancy calculator API, cudaOccupancyMaxActiveBlocksPerMultiprocessor , can provide an occupancy prediction based on the block size and shared memory usage of a kernel. This function reports occupancy in terms of the number of concurrent thread blocks per multiprocessor. Note that this value can be converted to other metrics. Multiplying by the number of warps per block yields the number of concurrent warps per multiprocessor; further dividing concurrent warps by max warps per multiprocessor gives the occupancy as a percentage. The occupancy-based launch configurator APIs, cudaOccupancyMaxPotentialBlockSize and cudaOccupancyMaxPotentialBlockSizeVariableSMem , heuristically calculate an execution configuration that achieves the maximum multiprocessor-level occupancy. The occupancy calculator API, cudaOccupancyMaxActiveClusters , can provided occupancy prediction based on the cluster size, block size and shared memory usage of a kernel. This function reports occupancy in terms of number of max active clusters of a given size on the GPU present in the system. The following code sample calculates the occupancy of MyKernel. It then reports the occupancy level with the ratio between concurrent warps versus maximum warps per multiprocessor. // Device code __global__ void MyKernel(int *d, int *a, int *b) { int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x; d[idx] = a[idx] * b[idx]; } // Host code int main() { int numBlocks; // Occupancy in terms of active blocks int blockSize = 32; // These variables are used to convert occupancy to warps int device; cudaDeviceProp prop; int activeWarps; int maxWarps; cudaGetDevice(&amp;device); cudaGetDeviceProperties(&amp;prop, device); cudaOccupancyMaxActiveBlocksPerMultiprocessor( &amp;numBlocks, MyKernel, blockSize, 0); activeWarps = numBlocks * blockSize / prop.warpSize; maxWarps = prop.maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor / prop.warpSize; std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Occupancy: &quot; &lt;&lt; (double)activeWarps / maxWarps * 100 &lt;&lt; &quot;%&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; return 0; } The following code sample configures an occupancy-based kernel launch of MyKernel according to the user input. // Device code __global__ void MyKernel(int *array, int arrayCount) { int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x; if (idx &lt; arrayCount) { array[idx] *= array[idx]; } } // Host code int launchMyKernel(int *array, int arrayCount) { int blockSize; // The launch configurator returned block size int minGridSize; // The minimum grid size needed to achieve the // maximum occupancy for a full device // launch int gridSize; // The actual grid size needed, based on input // size cudaOccupancyMaxPotentialBlockSize( &amp;minGridSize, &amp;blockSize, (void*)MyKernel, 0, arrayCount); // Round up according to array size gridSize = (arrayCount + blockSize - 1) / blockSize; MyKernel&lt;&lt;&lt;gridSize, blockSize&gt;&gt;&gt;(array, arrayCount); cudaDeviceSynchronize(); // If interested, the occupancy can be calculated with // cudaOccupancyMaxActiveBlocksPerMultiprocessor return 0; } The following code sample shows how to use the cluster occupancy API to find the max number of active clusters of a given size. Example code below calucaltes occupancy for cluster of size 2 and 128 threads per block. Cluster size of 8 is forward compatible starting compute capability 9.0, except on GPU hardware or MIG configurations which are too small to support 8 multiprocessors in which case the maximum cluster size will be reduced. But it is recommended that the users query the maximum cluster size before launching a cluster kernel.

It provides both the means for applications to define their own groups of threads, and the interfaces to synchronize them. It also provides new launch APIs that enforce certain restrictions and therefore can guarantee the synchronization will work. These primitives enable new patterns of cooperative parallelism within CUDA, including producer-consumer parallelism, opportunistic parallelism, and global synchronization across the entire Grid. The Cooperative Groups programming model consists of the following elements: Data types for representing groups of cooperating threads; Operations to obtain implicit groups defined by the CUDA launch API (e.g., thread blocks); Collectives for partitioning existing groups into new groups; Collective Algorithms for data movement and manipulation (e.g. memcpy_async, reduce, scan); An operation to synchronize all threads within the group; Operations to inspect the group properties; Collectives that expose low-level, group-specific and often HW accelerated, operations. The main concept in Cooperative Groups is that of objects naming the set of threads that are part of it. This expression of groups as first-class program objects improves software composition, since collective functions can receive an explicit object representing the group of participating threads. This object also makes programmer intent explicit, which eliminates unsound architectural assumptions that result in brittle code, undesirable restrictions upon compiler optimizations, and better compatibility with new GPU generations. To write efficient code, its best to use specialized groups (going generic loses a lot of compile time optimizations), and pass these group objects by reference to functions that intend to use these threads in some cooperative fashion. Cooperative Groups requires CUDA 9.0 or later. To use Cooperative Groups, include the header file: // Primary header is compatible with pre-C++11, collective algorithm headers require C++11 #include &lt;cooperative_groups.h&gt; // Optionally include for memcpy_async() collective #include &lt;cooperative_groups/memcpy_async.h&gt; // Optionally include for reduce() collective #include &lt;cooperative_groups/reduce.h&gt; // Optionally include for inclusive_scan() and exclusive_scan() collectives #include &lt;cooperative_groups/scan.h&gt; and use the Cooperative Groups namespace: using namespace cooperative_groups; // Alternatively use an alias to avoid polluting the namespace with collective algorithms namespace cg = cooperative_groups; The code can be compiled in a normal way using nvcc, however if you wish to use memcpy_async, reduce or scan functionality and your host compiler\u2019s default dialect is not C++11 or higher, then you must add --std=c++11 to the command line.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 529, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#prohibited-and-unhandled-operations", "display_name": "Prohibited and Unhandled Operations", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "prohibited-and-unhandled-operations", "priority": -1, "content": "It is invalid to synchronize or query the execution status of a stream which is being captured or a captured event, because they do not represent items scheduled for execution. It is also invalid to query the execution status of or synchronize a broader handle which encompasses an active stream capture, such as a device or context handle when any associated stream is in capture mode. When any stream in the same context is being captured, and it was not created with cudaStreamNonBlocking , any attempted use of the legacy stream is invalid. This is because the legacy stream handle at all times encompasses these other streams; enqueueing to the legacy stream would create a dependency on the streams being captured, and querying it or synchronizing it would query or synchronize the streams being captured. It is therefore also invalid to call synchronous APIs in this case. Synchronous APIs, such as cudaMemcpy() , enqueue work to the legacy stream and synchronize it before returning. As a general rule, when a dependency relation would connect something that is captured with something that was not captured and instead enqueued for execution, CUDA prefers to return an error rather than ignore the dependency. An exception is made for placing a stream into or out of capture mode; this severs a dependency relation between items added to the stream immediately before and after the mode transition.

Restricted pointers were introduced in C99 to alleviate the aliasing problem that exists in C-type languages, and which inhibits all kind of optimization from code re-ordering to common sub-expression elimination. Here is an example subject to the aliasing issue, where use of restricted pointer can help the compiler to reduce the number of instructions: void foo(const float* a, const float* b, float* c) { c[0] = a[0] * b[0]; c[1] = a[0] * b[0]; c[2] = a[0] * b[0] * a[1]; c[3] = a[0] * a[1]; c[4] = a[0] * b[0]; c[5] = b[0]; ... } In C-type languages, the pointers a , b , and c may be aliased, so any write through c could modify elements of a or b . This means that to guarantee functional correctness, the compiler cannot load a[0] and b[0] into registers, multiply them, and store the result to both c[0] and c[1] , because the results would differ from the abstract execution model if, say, a[0] is really the same location as c[0] . So the compiler cannot take advantage of the common sub-expression. Likewise, the compiler cannot just reorder the computation of c[4] into the proximity of the computation of c[0] and c[1] because the preceding write to c[3] could change the inputs to the computation of c[4] . By making a , b , and c restricted pointers, the programmer asserts to the compiler that the pointers are in fact not aliased, which in this case means writes through c would never overwrite elements of a or b . This changes the function prototype as follows: void foo(const float* __restrict__ a, const float* __restrict__ b, float* __restrict__ c); Note that all pointer arguments need to be made restricted for the compiler optimizer to derive any benefit. With the __restrict__ keywords added, the compiler can now reorder and do common sub-expression elimination at will, while retaining functionality identical with the abstract execution model: void foo(const float* __restrict__ a, const float* __restrict__ b, float* __restrict__ c) { float t0 = a[0]; float t1 = b[0]; float t2 = t0 * t1; float t3 = a[1]; c[0] = t2; c[1] = t2; c[4] = t2; c[2] = t2 * t3; c[3] = t0 * t3; c[5] = t1; ... } The effects here are a reduced number of memory accesses and reduced number of computations. This is balanced by an increase in register pressure due to \u201ccached\u201d loads and common sub-expressions. Since register pressure is a critical issue in many CUDA codes, use of restricted pointers can have negative performance impact on CUDA code, due to reduced occupancy.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 544, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#restrictions", "display_name": "Restrictions", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "restrictions", "priority": -1, "content": "__assume() is only supported when using cl.exe host compiler.

As illustrated in Figure 9 , Csub is equal to the product of two rectangular matrices: the sub-matrix of A of dimension ( A.width, block_size ) that has the same row indices as Csub , and the sub-matrix of B of dimension ( block_size, A.width )that has the same column indices as Csub . In order to fit into the device\u2019s resources, these two rectangular matrices are divided into as many square matrices of dimension block_size as necessary and Csub is computed as the sum of the products of these square matrices. Each of these products is performed by first loading the two corresponding square matrices from global memory to shared memory with one thread loading one element of each matrix, and then by having each thread compute one element of the product. Each thread accumulates the result of each of these products into a register and once done writes the result to global memory. By blocking the computation this way, we take advantage of fast shared memory and save a lot of global memory bandwidth since A is only read ( B.width / block_size ) times from global memory and B is read ( A.height / block_size ) times. The Matrix type from the previous code sample is augmented with a stride field, so that sub-matrices can be efficiently represented with the same type. __device__ functions are used to get and set elements and build any sub-matrix from a matrix. // Matrices are stored in row-major order: // M(row, col) = *(M.elements + row * M.stride + col) typedef struct { int width; int height; int stride; float* elements; } Matrix; // Get a matrix element __device__ float GetElement(const Matrix A, int row, int col) { return A.elements[row * A.stride + col]; } // Set a matrix element __device__ void SetElement(Matrix A, int row, int col, float value) { A.elements[row * A.stride + col] = value; } // Get the BLOCK_SIZExBLOCK_SIZE sub-matrix Asub of A that is // located col sub-matrices to the right and row sub-matrices down // from the upper-left corner of A __device__ Matrix GetSubMatrix(Matrix A, int row, int col) { Matrix Asub; Asub.width = BLOCK_SIZE; Asub.height = BLOCK_SIZE; Asub.stride = A.stride; Asub.elements = &amp;A.elements[A.stride * BLOCK_SIZE * row + BLOCK_SIZE * col]; return Asub; } // Thread block size #define BLOCK_SIZE 16 // Forward declaration of the matrix multiplication kernel __global__ void MatMulKernel(const Matrix, const Matrix, Matrix); // Matrix multiplication - Host code // Matrix dimensions are assumed to be multiples of BLOCK_SIZE void MatMul(const Matrix A, const Matrix B, Matrix C) { // Load A and B to device memory Matrix d_A; d_A.width = d_A.stride = A.width; d_A.height = A.height; size_t size = A.width * A.height * sizeof(float); cudaMalloc(&amp;d_A.elements, size); cudaMemcpy(d_A.elements, A.elements, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice); Matrix d_B; d_B.width = d_B.stride = B.width; d_B.height = B.height; size = B.width * B.height * sizeof(float); cudaMalloc(&amp;d_B.elements, size); cudaMemcpy(d_B.elements, B.elements, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice); // Allocate C in device memory Matrix d_C; d_C.width = d_C.stride = C.width; d_C.height = C.height; size = C.width * C.height * sizeof(float); cudaMalloc(&amp;d_C.elements, size); // Invoke kernel dim3 dimBlock(BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE); dim3 dimGrid(B.width / dimBlock.x, A.height / dimBlock.y); MatMulKernel&lt;&lt;&lt;dimGrid, dimBlock&gt;&gt;&gt;(d_A, d_B, d_C); // Read C from device memory cudaMemcpy(C.elements, d_C.elements, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost); // Free device memory cudaFree(d_A.elements); cudaFree(d_B.elements); cudaFree(d_C.elements); } // Matrix multiplication kernel called by MatMul() __global__ void MatMulKernel(Matrix A, Matrix B, Matrix C) { // Block row and column int blockRow = blockIdx.y; int blockCol = blockIdx.x; // Each thread block computes one sub-matrix Csub of C Matrix Csub = GetSubMatrix(C, blockRow, blockCol); // Each thread computes one element of Csub // by accumulating results into Cvalue float Cvalue = 0; // Thread row and column within Csub int row = threadIdx.y; int col = threadIdx.x; // Loop over all the sub-matrices of A and B that are // required to compute Csub // Multiply each pair of sub-matrices together // and accumulate the results for (int m = 0; m &lt; (A.width / BLOCK_SIZE); ++m) { // Get sub-matrix Asub of A Matrix Asub = GetSubMatrix(A, blockRow, m); // Get sub-matrix Bsub of B Matrix Bsub = GetSubMatrix(B, m, blockCol); // Shared memory used to store Asub and Bsub respectively __shared__ float As[BLOCK_SIZE][BLOCK_SIZE]; __shared__ float Bs[BLOCK_SIZE][BLOCK_SIZE]; // Load Asub and Bsub from device memory to shared memory // Each thread loads one element of each sub-matrix As[row][col] = GetElement(Asub, row, col); Bs[row][col] = GetElement(Bsub, row, col); // Synchronize to make sure the sub-matrices are loaded // before starting the computation __syncthreads(); // Multiply Asub and Bsub together for (int e = 0; e &lt; BLOCK_SIZE; ++e) Cvalue += As[row][e] * Bs[e][col]; // Synchronize to make sure that the preceding // computation is done before loading two new // sub-matrices of A and B in the next iteration __syncthreads(); } // Write Csub to device memory // Each thread writes one element SetElement(Csub, row, col, Cvalue); } Matrix Multiplication with Shared Memory", "keywords": []}, {"id": 558, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#shared-memory-5-x", "display_name": "Shared Memory", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "shared-memory-5-x", "priority": -1, "content": "Shared memory has 32 banks that are organized such that successive 32-bit words map to successive banks.

For the Volta architecture (compute capability 7.0), the unified data cache has a size of 128 KB, and the shared memory capacity can be set to 0, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 96 KB. For the Turing architecture (compute capability 7.5), the unified data cache has a size of 96 KB, and the shared memory capacity can be set to either 32 KB or 64 KB. Unlike Kepler, the driver automatically configures the shared memory capacity for each kernel to avoid shared memory occupancy bottlenecks while also allowing concurrent execution with already launched kernels where possible. In most cases, the driver\u2019s default behavior should provide optimal performance. Because the driver is not always aware of the full workload, it is sometimes useful for applications to provide additional hints regarding the desired shared memory configuration. For example, a kernel with little or no shared memory use may request a larger carveout in order to encourage concurrent execution with later kernels that require more shared memory. The new cudaFuncSetAttribute() API allows applications to set a preferred shared memory capacity, or carveout , as a percentage of the maximum supported shared memory capacity (96 KB for Volta , and 64 KB for Turing ). cudaFuncSetAttribute() relaxes enforcement of the preferred shared capacity compared to the legacy cudaFuncSetCacheConfig() API introduced with Kepler. The legacy API treated shared memory capacities as hard requirements for kernel launch. As a result, interleaving kernels with different shared memory configurations would needlessly serialize launches behind shared memory reconfigurations. With the new API, the carveout is treated as a hint. The driver may choose a different configuration if required to execute the function or to avoid thrashing. // Device code __global__ void MyKernel(...) { __shared__ float buffer[BLOCK_DIM]; ... } // Host code int carveout = 50; // prefer shared memory capacity 50% of maximum // Named Carveout Values: // carveout = cudaSharedmemCarveoutDefault; // (-1) // carveout = cudaSharedmemCarveoutMaxL1; // (0) // carveout = cudaSharedmemCarveoutMaxShared; // (100) cudaFuncSetAttribute(MyKernel, cudaFuncAttributePreferredSharedMemoryCarveout, carveout); MyKernel &lt;&lt;&lt;gridDim, BLOCK_DIM&gt;&gt;&gt;(...); In addition to an integer percentage, several convenience enums are provided as listed in the code comments above. Where a chosen integer percentage does not map exactly to a supported capacity (SM 7.0 devices support shared capacities of 0, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 96 KB), the next larger capacity is used. For instance, in the example above, 50% of the 96 KB maximum is 48 KB, which is not a supported shared memory capacity. Thus, the preference is rounded up to 64 KB. Compute capability 7.x devices allow a single thread block to address the full capacity of shared memory: 96 KB on Volta , 64 KB on Turing . Kernels relying on shared memory allocations over 48 KB per block are architecture-specific, as such they must use dynamic shared memory (rather than statically sized arrays) and require an explicit opt-in using cudaFuncSetAttribute() as follows. // Device code __global__ void MyKernel(...) { extern __shared__ float buffer[]; ... } // Host code int maxbytes = 98304; // 96 KB cudaFuncSetAttribute(MyKernel, cudaFuncAttributeMaxDynamicSharedMemorySize, maxbytes); MyKernel &lt;&lt;&lt;gridDim, blockDim, maxbytes&gt;&gt;&gt;(...); Otherwise, shared memory behaves the same way as for devices of compute capability 5.x (See Shared Memory ).", "keywords": []}, {"id": 561, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#shared-memory-8-x", "display_name": "Shared Memory", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "shared-memory-8-x", "priority": -1, "content": "Similar to the Volta architecture , the amount of the unified data cache reserved for shared memory is configurable on a per kernel basis.

Individual threads composing a warp start together at the same program address, but they have their own instruction address counter and register state and are therefore free to branch and execute independently. The term warp originates from weaving, the first parallel thread technology. A half-warp is either the first or second half of a warp. A quarter-warp is either the first, second, third, or fourth quarter of a warp. When a multiprocessor is given one or more thread blocks to execute, it partitions them into warps and each warp gets scheduled by a warp scheduler for execution. The way a block is partitioned into warps is always the same; each warp contains threads of consecutive, increasing thread IDs with the first warp containing thread 0. Thread Hierarchy describes how thread IDs relate to thread indices in the block. A warp executes one common instruction at a time, so full efficiency is realized when all 32 threads of a warp agree on their execution path. If threads of a warp diverge via a data-dependent conditional branch, the warp executes each branch path taken, disabling threads that are not on that path. Branch divergence occurs only within a warp; different warps execute independently regardless of whether they are executing common or disjoint code paths. The SIMT architecture is akin to SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) vector organizations in that a single instruction controls multiple processing elements. A key difference is that SIMD vector organizations expose the SIMD width to the software, whereas SIMT instructions specify the execution and branching behavior of a single thread. In contrast with SIMD vector machines, SIMT enables programmers to write thread-level parallel code for independent, scalar threads, as well as data-parallel code for coordinated threads. For the purposes of correctness, the programmer can essentially ignore the SIMT behavior; however, substantial performance improvements can be realized by taking care that the code seldom requires threads in a warp to diverge. In practice, this is analogous to the role of cache lines in traditional code: Cache line size can be safely ignored when designing for correctness but must be considered in the code structure when designing for peak performance. Vector architectures, on the other hand, require the software to coalesce loads into vectors and manage divergence manually. Prior to NVIDIA Volta, warps used a single program counter shared amongst all 32 threads in the warp together with an active mask specifying the active threads of the warp. As a result, threads from the same warp in divergent regions or different states of execution cannot signal each other or exchange data, and algorithms requiring fine-grained sharing of data guarded by locks or mutexes can easily lead to deadlock, depending on which warp the contending threads come from. Starting with the NVIDIA Volta architecture, Independent Thread Scheduling allows full concurrency between threads, regardless of warp. With Independent Thread Scheduling, the GPU maintains execution state per thread, including a program counter and call stack, and can yield execution at a per-thread granularity, either to make better use of execution resources or to allow one thread to wait for data to be produced by another. A schedule optimizer determines how to group active threads from the same warp together into SIMT units. This retains the high throughput of SIMT execution as in prior NVIDIA GPUs, but with much more flexibility: threads can now diverge and reconverge at sub-warp granularity. Independent Thread Scheduling can lead to a rather different set of threads participating in the executed code than intended if the developer made assumptions about warp-synchronicity 2 of previous hardware architectures. In particular, any warp-synchronous code (such as synchronization-free, intra-warp reductions) should be revisited to ensure compatibility with NVIDIA Volta and beyond. See Compute Capability 7.x for further details. The threads of a warp that are participating in the current instruction are called the active threads, whereas threads not on the current instruction are inactive (disabled). Threads can be inactive for a variety of reasons including having exited earlier than other threads of their warp, having taken a different branch path than the branch path currently executed by the warp, or being the last threads of a block whose number of threads is not a multiple of the warp size. If a non-atomic instruction executed by a warp writes to the same location in global or shared memory for more than one of the threads of the warp, the number of serialized writes that occur to that location varies depending on the compute capability of the device (see Compute Capability 5.x , Compute Capability 6.x , and Compute Capability 7.x ), and which thread performs the final write is undefined. If an atomic instruction executed by a warp reads, modifies, and writes to the same location in global memory for more than one of the threads of the warp, each read/modify/write to that location occurs and they are all serialized, but the order in which they occur is undefined.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 573, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#single-stage-asynchronous-data-copies-using-cuda-pipeline", "display_name": "Single-Stage Asynchronous Data Copies using cuda::pipeline", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "single-stage-asynchronous-data-copies-using-cuda-pipeline", "priority": -1, "content": "In previous examples we showed how to use cooperative_groups and cuda::barrier to do asynchronous data transfers.

A producer thread waits for the consumer threads to signal that the shared memory buffer can be filled. In order to wait for a cuda::barrier a producer thread must first arrive on that ready[i%2].arrive() to get a token and then ready[i%2].wait(token) with that token.

A producer thread does not wait at this point, instead it waits until the next iteration\u2019s buffer (double buffering) is ready to be filled. A consumer thread begins by signaling that both buffers are ready to be filled. A consumer thread does not wait at this point, instead it waits for this iteration\u2019s buffer to be filled, filled[i%2].arrive_and_wait() .

The allocator also allows applications to control the allocator\u2019s memory caching behavior. When set up with an appropriate release threshold, the caching behavior allows the allocator to avoid expensive calls into the OS when the application indicates it is willing to accept a bigger memory footprint.

Each calling thread must have its own bit set in the mask and all non-exited threads named in mask must execute a corresponding __syncwarp() with the same mask, or the result is undefined. Executing __syncwarp() guarantees memory ordering among threads participating in the barrier. Thus, threads within a warp that wish to communicate via memory can store to memory, execute __syncwarp() , and then safely read values stored by other threads in the warp. For .target sm_6x or below, all threads in mask must execute the same __syncwarp() in convergence, and the union of all values in mask must be equal to the active mask. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 622, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#synchronization-instruction", "display_name": "Synchronization Instruction", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "synchronization-instruction", "priority": -1, "content": "Throughput for __syncthreads() is 32 operations per clock cycle for devices of compute capability 6.0, 16 operations per clock cycle for devices of compute capability 7.x as well as 8.x and 64 operations per clock cycle for devices of compute capability 5.x, 6.1 and 6.2.

The next three tabs show various ways a file-scope or global-scope variable can be accessed from the device. Note that for the extern variable, it could be declared and its memory owned and managed by a third-party library, which does not interact with CUDA at all. Also note that stack variables as well as file-scope and global-scope variables can only be accessed through a pointer by the GPU. In this specific example, this is convenient because the character array is already declared as a pointer: const char* . However, consider the following example with a global-scope integer: // this variable is declared at global scope int global_variable; __global__ void kernel_uncompilable() { // this causes a compilation error: global (__host__) variables must not // be accessed from __device__ / __global__ code printf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, global_variable); } // On systems with pageableMemoryAccess set to 1, we can access the address // of a global variable. The below kernel takes that address as an argument __global__ void kernel(int* global_variable_addr) { printf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, *global_variable_addr); } int main() { kernel&lt;&lt;&lt;1, 1&gt;&gt;&gt;(&amp;global_variable); ... return 0; } In the example above, we need to ensure to pass a pointer to the global variable to the kernel instead of directly accessing the global variable in the kernel. This is because global variables without the __managed__ specifier are declared as __host__ -only by default, thus most compilers won\u2019t allow using these variables directly in device code as of now.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 630, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#system-requirements-for-unified-memory", "display_name": "System Requirements for Unified Memory", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "system-requirements-for-unified-memory", "priority": -1, "content": "The following table shows the different levels of support for CUDA Unified Memory, the device properties required to detect these levels of support and links to the documentation specific to each level of support: Unified Memory Support Level System device properties Further documentation Full CUDA Unified Memory: all memory has full support.

It is performed by the tex2Dgather() function, which has the same parameters as tex2D() , plus an additional comp parameter equal to 0, 1, 2, or 3 (see tex2Dgather() ). It returns four 32-bit numbers that correspond to the value of the component comp of each of the four texels that would have been used for bilinear filtering during a regular texture fetch. For example, if these texels are of values (253, 20, 31, 255), (250, 25, 29, 254), (249, 16, 37, 253), (251, 22, 30, 250), and comp is 2, tex2Dgather() returns (31, 29, 37, 30). Note that texture coordinates are computed with only 8 bits of fractional precision. tex2Dgather() may therefore return unexpected results for cases where tex2D() would use 1.0 for one of its weights (\u03b1 or \u03b2, see Linear Filtering ). For example, with an x texture coordinate of 2.49805: xB=x-0.5=1.99805 , however the fractional part of xB is stored in an 8-bit fixed-point format. Since 0.99805 is closer to 256.f/256.f than it is to 255.f/256.f, xB has the value 2. A tex2Dgather() in this case would therefore return indices 2 and 3 in x , instead of indices 1 and 2.

The process of reading a texture calling one of these functions is called a texture fetch . Each texture fetch specifies a parameter called a texture object for the texture object API. The texture object specifies: The texture , which is the piece of texture memory that is fetched. Texture objects are created at runtime and the texture is specified when creating the texture object as described in Texture Object API . Its dimensionality that specifies whether the texture is addressed as a one dimensional array using one texture coordinate, a two-dimensional array using two texture coordinates, or a three-dimensional array using three texture coordinates. Elements of the array are called texels , short for texture elements . The texture width , height , and depth refer to the size of the array in each dimension. Table 21 lists the maximum texture width, height, and depth depending on the compute capability of the device. The type of a texel, which is restricted to the basic integer and single-precision floating-point types and any of the 1-, 2-, and 4-component vector types defined in Built-in Vector Types that are derived from the basic integer and single-precision floating-point types. The read mode , which is equal to cudaReadModeNormalizedFloat or cudaReadModeElementType . If it is cudaReadModeNormalizedFloat and the type of the texel is a 16-bit or 8-bit integer type, the value returned by the texture fetch is actually returned as floating-point type and the full range of the integer type is mapped to [0.0, 1.0] for unsigned integer type and [-1.0, 1.0] for signed integer type; for example, an unsigned 8-bit texture element with the value 0xff reads as 1. If it is cudaReadModeElementType , no conversion is performed. Whether texture coordinates are normalized or not. By default, textures are referenced (by the functions of Texture Functions ) using floating-point coordinates in the range [0, N-1] where N is the size of the texture in the dimension corresponding to the coordinate. For example, a texture that is 64x32 in size will be referenced with coordinates in the range [0, 63] and [0, 31] for the x and y dimensions, respectively. Normalized texture coordinates cause the coordinates to be specified in the range [0.0, 1.0-1/N] instead of [0, N-1], so the same 64x32 texture would be addressed by normalized coordinates in the range [0, 1-1/N] in both the x and y dimensions. Normalized texture coordinates are a natural fit to some applications\u2019 requirements, if it is preferable for the texture coordinates to be independent of the texture size. The addressing mode . It is valid to call the device functions of Section B.8 with coordinates that are out of range. The addressing mode defines what happens in that case. The default addressing mode is to clamp the coordinates to the valid range: [0, N) for non-normalized coordinates and [0.0, 1.0) for normalized coordinates. If the border mode is specified instead, texture fetches with out-of-range texture coordinates return zero. For normalized coordinates, the wrap mode and the mirror mode are also available. When using the wrap mode, each coordinate x is converted to frac(x)=x - floor(x) where floor(x) is the largest integer not greater than x . When using the mirror mode, each coordinate x is converted to frac(x) if floor(x) is even and 1-frac(x) if floor(x) is odd. The addressing mode is specified as an array of size three whose first, second, and third elements specify the addressing mode for the first, second, and third texture coordinates, respectively; the addressing mode are cudaAddressModeBorder , cudaAddressModeClamp , cudaAddressModeWrap , and cudaAddressModeMirror ; cudaAddressModeWrap and cudaAddressModeMirror are only supported for normalized texture coordinates The filtering mode which specifies how the value returned when fetching the texture is computed based on the input texture coordinates. Linear texture filtering may be done only for textures that are configured to return floating-point data. It performs low-precision interpolation between neighboring texels. When enabled, the texels surrounding a texture fetch location are read and the return value of the texture fetch is interpolated based on where the texture coordinates fell between the texels. Simple linear interpolation is performed for one-dimensional textures, bilinear interpolation for two-dimensional textures, and trilinear interpolation for three-dimensional textures. Texture Fetching gives more details on texture fetching. The filtering mode is equal to cudaFilterModePoint or cudaFilterModeLinear . If it is cudaFilterModePoint , the returned value is the texel whose texture coordinates are the closest to the input texture coordinates. If it is cudaFilterModeLinear , the returned value is the linear interpolation of the two (for a one-dimensional texture), four (for a two dimensional texture), or eight (for a three dimensional texture) texels whose texture coordinates are the closest to the input texture coordinates. cudaFilterModeLinear is only valid for returned values of floating-point type. Texture Object API introduces the texture object API. 16-Bit Floating-Point Textures explains how to deal with 16-bit floating-point textures.

Many applications leverage these higher capabilities to run faster on the GPU than on the CPU (see GPU Applications ). Other computing devices, like FPGAs, are also very energy efficient, but offer much less programming flexibility than GPUs. This difference in capabilities between the GPU and the CPU exists because they are designed with different goals in mind. While the CPU is designed to excel at executing a sequence of operations, called a thread , as fast as possible and can execute a few tens of these threads in parallel, the GPU is designed to excel at executing thousands of them in parallel (amortizing the slower single-thread performance to achieve greater throughput). The GPU is specialized for highly parallel computations and therefore designed such that more transistors are devoted to data processing rather than data caching and flow control. The schematic Figure 1 shows an example distribution of chip resources for a CPU versus a GPU. The GPU Devotes More Transistors to Data Processing Devoting more transistors to data processing, for example, floating-point computations, is beneficial for highly parallel computations; the GPU can hide memory access latencies with computation, instead of relying on large data caches and complex flow control to avoid long memory access latencies, both of which are expensive in terms of transistors.

Similar to how threads in a thread block are guaranteed to be co-scheduled on a streaming multiprocessor, thread blocks in a cluster are also guaranteed to be co-scheduled on a GPU Processing Cluster (GPC) in the GPU. Similar to thread blocks, clusters are also organized into a one-dimension, two-dimension, or three-dimension as illustrated by Figure 5 . The number of thread blocks in a cluster can be user-defined, and a maximum of 8 thread blocks in a cluster is supported as a portable cluster size in CUDA. Note that on GPU hardware or MIG configurations which are too small to support 8 multiprocessors the maximum cluster size will be reduced accordingly. Identification of these smaller configurations, as well as of larger configurations supporting a thread block cluster size beyond 8, is architecture-specific and can be queried using the cudaOccupancyMaxPotentialClusterSize API. Grid of Thread Block Clusters In a kernel launched using cluster support, the gridDim variable still denotes the size in terms of number of thread blocks, for compatibility purposes. The rank of a block in a cluster can be found using the Cluster Group API. A thread block cluster can be enabled in a kernel either using a compiler time kernel attribute using __cluster_dims__(X,Y,Z) or using the CUDA kernel launch API cudaLaunchKernelEx . The example below shows how to launch a cluster using compiler time kernel attribute. The cluster size using kernel attribute is fixed at compile time and then the kernel can be launched using the classical &lt;&lt;&lt; , &gt;&gt;&gt; . If a kernel uses compile-time cluster size, the cluster size cannot be modified when launching the kernel. // Kernel definition // Compile time cluster size 2 in X-dimension and 1 in Y and Z dimension __global__ void __cluster_dims__(2, 1, 1) cluster_kernel(float *input, float* output) { } int main() { float *input, *output; // Kernel invocation with compile time cluster size dim3 threadsPerBlock(16, 16); dim3 numBlocks(N / threadsPerBlock.x, N / threadsPerBlock.y); // The grid dimension is not affected by cluster launch, and is still enumerated // using number of blocks. // The grid dimension must be a multiple of cluster size. cluster_kernel&lt;&lt;&lt;numBlocks, threadsPerBlock&gt;&gt;&gt;(input, output); } A thread block cluster size can also be set at runtime and the kernel can be launched using the CUDA kernel launch API cudaLaunchKernelEx . The code example below shows how to launch a cluster kernel using the extensible API. // Kernel definition // No compile time attribute attached to the kernel __global__ void cluster_kernel(float *input, float* output) { } int main() { float *input, *output; dim3 threadsPerBlock(16, 16); dim3 numBlocks(N / threadsPerBlock.x, N / threadsPerBlock.y); // Kernel invocation with runtime cluster size { cudaLaunchConfig_t config = {0}; // The grid dimension is not affected by cluster launch, and is still enumerated // using number of blocks. // The grid dimension should be a multiple of cluster size. config.gridDim = numBlocks; config.blockDim = threadsPerBlock; cudaLaunchAttribute attribute[1]; attribute[0].id = cudaLaunchAttributeClusterDimension; attribute[0].val.clusterDim.x = 2; // Cluster size in X-dimension attribute[0].val.clusterDim.y = 1; attribute[0].val.clusterDim.z = 1; config.attrs = attribute; config.numAttrs = 1; cudaLaunchKernelEx(&amp;config, cluster_kernel, input, output); } } In GPUs with compute capability 9.0, all the thread blocks in the cluster are guaranteed to be co-scheduled on a single GPU Processing Cluster (GPC) and allow thread blocks in the cluster to perform hardware-supported synchronization using the Cluster Group API cluster.sync() . Cluster group also provides member functions to query cluster group size in terms of number of threads or number of blocks using num_threads() and num_blocks() API respectively. The rank of a thread or block in the cluster group can be queried using dim_threads() and dim_blocks() API respectively.

It should consume no memory when instantiated in shared memory in cases where its not required. Examples: /// The following code will create two sets of tiled groups, of size 32 and 4 respectively: /// The latter has the provenance encoded in the type, while the first stores it in the handle thread_block block = this_thread_block(); thread_block_tile&lt;32&gt; tile32 = tiled_partition&lt;32&gt;(block); thread_block_tile&lt;4, thread_block&gt; tile4 = tiled_partition&lt;4&gt;(block); /// The following code will create tiles of size 128 on all Compute Capabilities. /// block_tile_memory can be omitted on Compute Capability 8.0 or higher. __global__ void kernel(...) { // reserve shared memory for thread_block_tile usage, // specify that block size will be at most 256 threads. __shared__ block_tile_memory&lt;256&gt; shared; thread_block thb = this_thread_block(shared); // Create tiles with 128 threads. auto tile = tiled_partition&lt;128&gt;(thb); // ... }", "keywords": []}, {"id": 689, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#thread-hierarchy", "display_name": "Thread Hierarchy", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "thread-hierarchy", "priority": -1, "content": "For convenience, threadIdx is a 3-component vector, so that threads can be identified using a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional thread index , forming a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional block of threads, called a thread block . This provides a natural way to invoke computation across the elements in a domain such as a vector, matrix, or volume. The index of a thread and its thread ID relate to each other in a straightforward way: For a one-dimensional block, they are the same; for a two-dimensional block of size (Dx, Dy) , the thread ID of a thread of index (x, y) is (x + y Dx) ; for a three-dimensional block of size (Dx, Dy, Dz) , the thread ID of a thread of index (x, y, z) is (x + y Dx + z Dx Dy) . As an example, the following code adds two matrices A and B of size NxN and stores the result into matrix C : // Kernel definition __global__ void MatAdd(float A[N][N], float B[N][N], float C[N][N]) { int i = threadIdx.x; int j = threadIdx.y; C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]; } int main() { ... // Kernel invocation with one block of N * N * 1 threads int numBlocks = 1; dim3 threadsPerBlock(N, N); MatAdd&lt;&lt;&lt;numBlocks, threadsPerBlock&gt;&gt;&gt;(A, B, C); ... } There is a limit to the number of threads per block, since all threads of a block are expected to reside on the same streaming multiprocessor core and must share the limited memory resources of that core. On current GPUs, a thread block may contain up to 1024 threads. However, a kernel can be executed by multiple equally-shaped thread blocks, so that the total number of threads is equal to the number of threads per block times the number of blocks. Blocks are organized into a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional grid of thread blocks as illustrated by Figure 4 . The number of thread blocks in a grid is usually dictated by the size of the data being processed, which typically exceeds the number of processors in the system. Grid of Thread Blocks The number of threads per block and the number of blocks per grid specified in the &lt;&lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt;&gt; syntax can be of type int or dim3 . Two-dimensional blocks or grids can be specified as in the example above. Each block within the grid can be identified by a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional unique index accessible within the kernel through the built-in blockIdx variable. The dimension of the thread block is accessible within the kernel through the built-in blockDim variable. Extending the previous MatAdd() example to handle multiple blocks, the code becomes as follows. // Kernel definition __global__ void MatAdd(float A[N][N], float B[N][N], float C[N][N]) { int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x; int j = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y; if (i &lt; N &amp;&amp; j &lt; N) C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]; } int main() { ... // Kernel invocation dim3 threadsPerBlock(16, 16); dim3 numBlocks(N / threadsPerBlock.x, N / threadsPerBlock.y); MatAdd&lt;&lt;&lt;numBlocks, threadsPerBlock&gt;&gt;&gt;(A, B, C); ... } A thread block size of 16x16 (256 threads), although arbitrary in this case, is a common choice. The grid is created with enough blocks to have one thread per matrix element as before. For simplicity, this example assumes that the number of threads per grid in each dimension is evenly divisible by the number of threads per block in that dimension, although that need not be the case. Thread blocks are required to execute independently: It must be possible to execute them in any order, in parallel or in series. This independence requirement allows thread blocks to be scheduled in any order across any number of cores as illustrated by Figure 3 , enabling programmers to write code that scales with the number of cores. Threads within a block can cooperate by sharing data through some shared memory and by synchronizing their execution to coordinate memory accesses. More precisely, one can specify synchronization points in the kernel by calling the __syncthreads() intrinsic function; __syncthreads() acts as a barrier at which all threads in the block must wait before any is allowed to proceed. Shared Memory gives an example of using shared memory. In addition to __syncthreads() , the Cooperative Groups API provides a rich set of thread-synchronization primitives. For efficient cooperation, the shared memory is expected to be a low-latency memory near each processor core (much like an L1 cache) and __syncthreads() is expected to be lightweight.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 690, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#thread-local", "display_name": "thread_local", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "thread-local", "priority": -1, "content": "The thread_local storage specifier is not allowed in device code.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 691, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#threadidx", "display_name": "threadIdx", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "threadidx", "priority": -1, "content": "This variable is of type uint3 (see char, short, int, long, longlong, float, double ) and contains the thread index within the block.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 692, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#three-way-comparison-operator", "display_name": "Three-way comparison operator", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "three-way-comparison-operator", "priority": -1, "content": "The three-way comparison operator is supported in both host and device code, but some uses implicitly rely on functionality from the Standard Template Library provided by the host implementation.

CUDA Managed Memory Allocation APIs : via the cudaMallocManaged() API which is syntactically similar to cudaMalloc() .

Unified Memory improves GPU programming in several ways: Producitivity : GPU programs may access Unified Memory from GPU and CPU threads concurrently without needing to create separate allocations ( cudaMalloc() ) and copy memory manually back and forth ( cudaMemcpy*() ). Performance : Data access speed may be maximized by migrating data towards processors that access it most frequently. Applications can trigger manual migration of data and may use hints to control migration heuristics. Total system memory usage may be reduced by avoiding duplicating memory on both CPUs and GPUs. Functionality : it enables GPU programs to work on data that exceeds the GPU memory\u2019s capacity. With CUDA Unified Memory, data movement still takes place, and hints may improve performance.

When copying to or from the memory of any device which uses the unified address space, the cudaMemcpyKind parameter of cudaMemcpy*() can be set to cudaMemcpyDefault to determine locations from the pointers. This also works for host pointers not allocated through CUDA, as long as the current device uses unified addressing. Allocations via cudaHostAlloc() are automatically portable (see Portable Memory ) across all the devices for which the unified address space is used, and pointers returned by cudaHostAlloc() can be used directly from within kernels running on these devices (i.e., there is no need to obtain a device pointer via cudaHostGetDevicePointer() as described in Mapped Memory . Applications may query if the unified address space is used for a particular device by checking that the unifiedAddressing device property (see Device Enumeration ) is equal to 1.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 712, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#updating-instantiated-graphs", "display_name": "Updating Instantiated Graphs", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "updating-instantiated-graphs", "priority": -1, "content": "Work submission using graphs is separated into three distinct stages: definition, instantiation, and execution. In situations where the workflow is not changing, the overhead of definition and instantiation can be amortized over many executions, and graphs provide a clear advantage over streams. A graph is a snapshot of a workflow, including kernels, parameters, and dependencies, in order to replay it as rapidly and efficiently as possible. In situations where the workflow changes the graph becomes out of date and must be modified. Major changes to graph structure such as topology or types of nodes will require re-instantiation of the source graph because various topology-related optimization techniques must be re-applied. The cost of repeated instantiation can reduce the overall performance benefit from graph execution, but it is common for only node parameters, such as kernel parameters and cudaMemcpy addresses, to change while graph topology remains the same. For this case, CUDA provides a lightweight mechanism known as \u201cGraph Update,\u201d which allows certain node parameters to be modified in-place without having to rebuild the entire graph. This is much more efficient than re-instantiation. Updates will take effect the next time the graph is launched, so they will not impact previous graph launches, even if they are running at the time of the update. A graph may be updated and relaunched repeatedly, so multiple updates/launches can be queued on a stream. CUDA provides two mechanisms for updating instantiated graph parameters, whole graph update and individual node update. Whole graph update allows the user to supply a topologically identical cudaGraph_t object whose nodes contain updated parameters. Individual node update allows the user to explicitly update the parameters of individual nodes. Using an updated cudaGraph_t is more convenient when a large number of nodes are being updated, or when the graph topology is unknown to the caller (i.e., The graph resulted from stream capture of a library call). Using individual node update is preferred when the number of changes is small and the user has the handles to the nodes requiring updates. Individual node update skips the topology checks and comparisons for unchanged nodes, so it can be more efficient in many cases. CUDA also provides a mechanism for enabling and disabling individual nodes without affecting their current parameters. The following sections explain each approach in more detail.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 713, "doc_id": 756, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#usage-of-a-modified-tensor-map", "display_name": "Usage of a Modified Tensor Map", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "usage-of-a-modified-tensor-map", "priority": -1, "content": "In contrast to using a tensor map that is passed as a const __grid_constant__ kernel parameter, using a tensor map in global memory requires explicitly establishing a release-acquire pattern in the tensor map proxy between the threads that modify the tensor map and the threads that use it. The release part of the pattern was shown in the previous section. It is accomplished using the cuda::ptx::tensormap.cp_fenceproxy function. The acquire part is accomplished using the cuda::ptx::fence_proxy_tensormap_generic function that wraps the fence.proxy.tensormap::generic.acquire instruction. If the two threads participating in the release-acquire pattern are on the same device, the .gpu scope suffices. If the threads are on different devices, the .sys scope must be used. Once a tensor map has been acquired by one thread, it can be used by other threads in the block after sufficient synchronization, for example, using __syncthreads() . The thread that uses the tensor map and the thread that performs the fence must be in the same block. That is, if the threads are in, for example, two different thread blocks of the same cluster, the same grid, or a different kernel, synchronization APIs such as cooperative_groups::cluster or grid_group::sync() or stream-order synchronization do not suffice to establish ordering for tensor map updates, that is, threads in these other thread blocks still need to acquire the tensor map proxy at the right scope before using the updated tensor map. If there are no intermediate modifications, the fence does not have to be repeated before each cp.async.bulk.tensor instruction. The fence and subsequent use of the tensor map is shown in the following example. // Consumer of tensor map in global memory: __global__ void consume_tensor_map(CUtensorMap* tensor_map) { // Fence acquire tensor map: ptx::n32_t&lt;128&gt; size_bytes; ptx::fence_proxy_tensormap_generic(ptx::sem_acquire, ptx::scope_sys, tensor_map, size_bytes); // Safe to use tensor_map after fence.. __shared__ uint64_t bar; __shared__ alignas(128) char smem_buf[4][128]; if (threadIdx.x == 0) { // Initialize barrier ptx::mbarrier_init(&amp;bar, 1); // Make barrier init visible in async proxy, i.e., to TMA engine ptx::fence_proxy_async(ptx::space_shared); // Issue TMA request ptx::cp_async_bulk_tensor(ptx::space_cluster, ptx::space_global, smem_buf, tensor_map, {0, 0}, &amp;bar); // Arrive on barrier.

The former selects between logical domains cudaLaunchMemSyncDomainDefault and cudaLaunchMemSyncDomainRemote , and the latter provides a mapping from logical to physical domains. The remote domain is intended for kernels performing remote memory access in order to isolate their memory traffic from local kernels. Note, however, the selection of a particular domain does not affect what memory access a kernel may legally perform. The domain count can be queried via device attribute cudaDevAttrMemSyncDomainCount . Hopper has 4 domains. To facilitate portable code, domains functionality can be used on all devices and CUDA will report a count of 1 prior to Hopper. Having logical domains eases application composition. An individual kernel launch at a low level in the stack, such as from NCCL, can select a semantic logical domain without concern for the surrounding application architecture. Higher levels can steer logical domains using the mapping. The default value for the logical domain if it is not set is the default domain, and the default mapping is to map the default domain to 0 and the remote domain to 1 (on GPUs with more than 1 domain). Specific libraries may tag launches with the remote domain in CUDA 12.0 and later; for example, NCCL 2.16 will do so. Together, this provides a beneficial use pattern for common applications out of the box, with no code changes needed in other components, frameworks, or at application level. An alternative use pattern, for example in an application using nvshmem or with no clear separation of kernel types, could be to partition parallel streams. Stream A may map both logical domains to physical domain 0, stream B to 1, and so on. // Example of launching a kernel with the remote logical domain cudaLaunchAttribute domainAttr; domainAttr.id = cudaLaunchAttrMemSyncDomain; domainAttr.val = cudaLaunchMemSyncDomainRemote; cudaLaunchConfig_t config; // Fill out other config fields config.attrs = &amp;domainAttr; config.numAttrs = 1; cudaLaunchKernelEx(&amp;config, myKernel, kernelArg1, kernelArg2...); // Example of setting a mapping for a stream // (This mapping is the default for streams starting on Hopper if not // explicitly set, and provided for illustration) cudaLaunchAttributeValue mapAttr; mapAttr.memSyncDomainMap.default_ = 0; mapAttr.memSyncDomainMap.remote = 1; cudaStreamSetAttribute(stream, cudaLaunchAttributeMemSyncDomainMap, &amp;mapAttr); // Example of mapping different streams to different physical domains, ignoring // logical domain settings cudaLaunchAttributeValue mapAttr; mapAttr.memSyncDomainMap.default_ = 0; mapAttr.memSyncDomainMap.remote = 0; cudaStreamSetAttribute(streamA, cudaLaunchAttributeMemSyncDomainMap, &amp;mapAttr); mapAttr.memSyncDomainMap.default_ = 1; mapAttr.memSyncDomainMap.remote = 1; cudaStreamSetAttribute(streamB, cudaLaunchAttributeMemSyncDomainMap, &amp;mapAttr); As with other launch attributes, these are exposed uniformly on CUDA streams, individual launches using cudaLaunchKernelEx , and kernel nodes in CUDA graphs.

Similarly, the CUDA version for retrieving the address to the _v2 version of the API should be 10.1 (10010). Specifying a higher CUDA version for retrieving a specific version of a driver API might not always be portable. For example, using 11030 here would still return the _v2 symbol, but if a hypothetical _v3 version is released in CUDA 11.3, the cuGetProcAddress API would start returning the newer _v3 symbol instead when paired with a CUDA 11.3 driver. Since the ABI and function signatures of the _v2 and _v3 symbols might differ, calling the _v3 function using the _v10010 typedef intended for the _v2 symbol would exhibit undefined behavior. To retrieve the latest version of a driver API for a given CUDA Toolkit, we can also specify CUDA_VERSION as the version argument and use the unversioned typedef to define the function pointer. Since _v2 is the latest version of the driver API cuStreamBeginCapture in CUDA 11.3, the below code snippet shows a different method to retrieve it. // Assuming we are using CUDA 11.3 Toolkit #include &lt;cudaTypedefs.h&gt; // Declare the entry point PFN_cuStreamBeginCapture pfn_cuStreamBeginCapture_latest; // Intialize the entry point.

This section describes how to create a tensor map using the CUDA driver API, how to pass it to device, and how to use it on device. Driver API . A tensor map is created using the cuTensorMapEncodeTiled driver API. This API can be accessed by linking to the driver directly ( -lcuda ) or by using the cudaGetDriverEntryPoint API. Below, we show how to get a pointer to the cuTensorMapEncodeTiled API. For more information, refer to Driver Entry Point Access . #include &lt;cudaTypedefs.h&gt; // PFN_cuTensorMapEncodeTiled, CUtensorMap PFN_cuTensorMapEncodeTiled_v12000 get_cuTensorMapEncodeTiled() { // Get pointer to cuTensorMapEncodeTiled cudaDriverEntryPointQueryResult driver_status; void* cuTensorMapEncodeTiled_ptr = nullptr; CUDA_CHECK(cudaGetDriverEntryPointByVersion(&quot;cuTensorMapEncodeTiled&quot;, &amp;cuTensorMapEncodeTiled_ptr, 12000, cudaEnableDefault, &amp;driver_status)); assert(driver_status == cudaDriverEntryPointSuccess); return reinterpret_cast&lt;PFN_cuTensorMapEncodeTiled_v12000&gt;(cuTensorMapEncodeTiled_ptr); } Creation . Creating a tensor map requires many parameters. Among them are the base pointer to an array in global memory, the size of the array (in number of elements), the stride from one row to the next (in bytes), the size of the shared memory buffer (in number of elements). The code below creates a tensor map to describe a two-dimensional row-major array of size GMEM_HEIGHT x GMEM_WIDTH . Note the order of the parameters: the fastest moving dimension comes first. CUtensorMap tensor_map{}; // rank is the number of dimensions of the array. constexpr uint32_t rank = 2; uint64_t size[rank] = {GMEM_WIDTH, GMEM_HEIGHT}; // The stride is the number of bytes to traverse from the first element of one row to the next. // It must be a multiple of 16. uint64_t stride[rank - 1] = {GMEM_WIDTH * sizeof(int)}; // The box_size is the size of the shared memory buffer that is used as the // destination of a TMA transfer. uint32_t box_size[rank] = {SMEM_WIDTH, SMEM_HEIGHT}; // The distance between elements in units of sizeof(element). A stride of 2 // can be used to load only the real component of a complex-valued tensor, for instance. uint32_t elem_stride[rank] = {1, 1}; // Get a function pointer to the cuTensorMapEncodeTiled driver API. auto cuTensorMapEncodeTiled = get_cuTensorMapEncodeTiled(); // Create the tensor descriptor.

CUtensorMapFloatOOBfill::CU_TENSOR_MAP_FLOAT_OOB_FILL_NONE ); Host-to-device transfer . There are three ways to make a tensor map accessible to device code. The recommended approach is to pass the tensor map as a const __grid_constant__ parameter to a kernel. The other possibilities are copying the tensor map into device __constant__ memory using cudaMemcpyToSymbol or accessing it via global memory. When passing the tensor map as a parameter, some versions of the GCC C++ compiler issue the warning \u201cthe ABI for passing parameters with 64-byte alignment has changed in GCC 4.6\u201d. This warning can be ignored. #include &lt;cuda.h&gt; __global__ void kernel(const __grid_constant__ CUtensorMap tensor_map) { // Use tensor_map here. } int main() { CUtensorMap map; // [ ..Initialize map.. ] kernel&lt;&lt;&lt;1, 1&gt;&gt;&gt;(map); } As an alternative to the __grid_constant__ kernel parameter, a global constant variable can be used. An example is included below. #include &lt;cuda.h&gt; __constant__ CUtensorMap global_tensor_map; __global__ void kernel() { // Use global_tensor_map here. } int main() { CUtensorMap local_tensor_map; // [ ..Initialize map.. ] cudaMemcpyToSymbol(global_tensor_map, &amp;local_tensor_map, sizeof(CUtensorMap)); kernel&lt;&lt;&lt;1, 1&gt;&gt;&gt;(); } Finally, it is possible to copy the tensor map to global memory. Using a pointer to a tensor map in global device memory requires a fence ineach thread block before any thread in the block uses the updated tensormap. Further uses of the tensormap by that thread block do not need to be fenced unless the tensormap is modified again. Note that this mechanism may be slower than the two mechanisms described above. #include &lt;cuda.h&gt; #include &lt;cuda/ptx&gt; namespace ptx = cuda::ptx; __device__ CUtensorMap global_tensor_map; __global__ void kernel(CUtensorMap *tensor_map) { // Fence acquire tensormap: ptx::n32_t&lt;128&gt; size_bytes; // Since the tensormap was modified from the host using cudaMemcpy, // the scope should be .sys. ptx::fence_proxy_tensormap_generic( bptx::sem_acquire, ptx::scope_sys, tensor_map, size_bytes ); // Safe to use tensor_map after fence inside this thread.. } int main() { CUtensorMap local_tensor_map; // [ ..Initialize map.. ] ccudaMemcpy(&amp;global_tensor_map, &amp;local_tensor_map, sizeof(CUtensorMap), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice); kernel&lt;&lt;&lt;1, 1&gt;&gt;&gt;(global_tensor_map); } Use . The kernel below loads a 2D tile of size SMEM_HEIGHT x SMEM_WIDTH from a larger 2D array. The top-left corner of the tile is indicated by the indices x and y . The tile is loaded into shared memory, modified, and written back to global memory. #include &lt;cuda.h&gt; // CUtensormap #include &lt;cuda/barrier&gt; using barrier = cuda::barrier&lt;cuda::thread_scope_block&gt;; namespace cde = cuda::device::experimental; __global__ void kernel(const __grid_constant__ CUtensorMap tensor_map, int x, int y) { // The destination shared memory buffer of a bulk tensor operation should be // 128 byte aligned. __shared__ alignas(128) int smem_buffer[SMEM_HEIGHT][SMEM_WIDTH]; // Initialize shared memory barrier with the number of threads participating in the barrier. #pragma nv_diag_suppress static_var_with_dynamic_init __shared__ barrier bar; if (threadIdx.x == 0) { // Initialize barrier.

This invalidates the memory region of the barrier. If // further computations were to take place in the kernel, this allows the // memory location of the shared memory barrier to be reused. if (threadIdx.x == 0) { (&amp;bar)-&gt;~barrier(); } } Negative indices and out of bounds . When part of the tile that is being read from global to shared memory is out of bounds, the shared memory that corresponds to the out of bounds area is zero-filled. The top-left corner indices of the tile may also be negative. When writing from shared to global memory, parts of the tile may be out of bounds, but the top left corner cannot have any negative indices. Size and stride . The size of a tensor is the number of elements along one dimension. All sizes must be greater than one. The stride is the number of bytes between elements of the same dimension. For instance, a 4 x 4 matrix of integers has sizes 4 and 4. Since it has 4 bytes per element, the strides are 4 and 16 bytes. Due to alignment requirements, a 4 x 3 row-major matrix of integers must have strides of 4 and 16 bytes as well. Each row is padded with 4 extra bytes to ensure that the start of the next row is aligned to 16 bytes. For more information regarding alignment, refer to Table Alignment requirements for multi-dimensional bulk tensor asynchronous copy operations in Compute Capability 9.0. . Address / Size Alignment Global memory address Must be 16 byte aligned. Global memory sizes Must be greater than or equal to one. Does not have to be a multiple of 16 bytes.

The barrier is initialized with the number of threads participating in the block. As a result, the barrier will flip only if all threads have arrived on this barrier. Shared memory barriers are described in more detail in Asynchronous Data Copies using cuda::barrier . To make the initialized barrier visible to subsequent bulk-asynchronous copies, the fence.proxy.async.shared::cta instruction is used. This instruction ensures that subsequent bulk-asynchronous copy operations operate on the initialized barrier. TMA read . The bulk-asynchronous copy instruction directs the hardware to copy a large chunk of data into shared memory, and to update the transaction count of the shared memory barrier after completing the read. In general, issuing as few bulk copies with as big a size as possible results in the best performance. Because the copy can be performed asynchronously by the hardware, it is not necessary to split the copy into smaller chunks. The thread that initiates the bulk-asynchronous copy operation arrives at the barrier using mbarrier.expect_tx . This is automatically performed by cuda::memcpy_async . This tells the barrier that the thread has arrived and also how many bytes (tx / transactions) are expected to arrive. Only a single thread has to update the expected transaction count. If multiple threads update the transaction count, the expected transaction will be the sum of the updates. The barrier will only flip once all threads have arrived and all bytes have arrived. Once the barrier has flipped, the bytes are safe to read from shared memory, both by the threads as well as by subsequent bulk-asynchronous copies. More information about barrier transaction accounting can be found in the PTX ISA . Barrier wait . Waiting for the barrier to flip is done using mbarrier.try_wait . It can either return true, indicating that the wait is over, or return false, which may mean that the wait timed out. The while loop waits for completion, and retries on time-out. SMEM write and sync . The increment of the buffer values reads and writes to shared memory. To make the writes visible to subsequent bulk-asynchronous copies, the fence.proxy.async.shared::cta instruction is used. This orders the writes to shared memory before subsequent reads from bulk-asynchronous copy operations, which read through the async proxy. So each thread first orders the writes to objects in shared memory in the async proxy via the fence.proxy.async.shared::cta , and these operations by all threads are ordered before the async operation performed in thread 0 using __syncthreads() . TMA write and sync . The write from shared to global memory is again initiated by a single thread. The completion of the write is not tracked by a shared memory barrier. Instead, a thread-local mechanism is used. Multiple writes can be batched into a so-called bulk async-group . Afterwards, the thread can wait for all operations in this group to have completed reading from shared memory (as in the code above) or to have completed writing to global memory, making the writes visible to the initiating thread. For more information, refer to the PTX ISA documentation of cp.async.bulk.wait_group . Note that the bulk-asynchronous and non-bulk asynchronous copy instructions have different async-groups: there exist both cp.async.wait_group and cp.async.bulk.wait_group instructions. The bulk-asynchronous instructions have specific alignment requirements on their source and destination addresses. More information can be found in the table below.

The version of the driver API is defined in the driver header file as CUDA_VERSION . It allows developers to check whether their application requires a newer device driver than the one currently installed. This is important, because the driver API is backward compatible , meaning that applications, plug-ins, and libraries (including the CUDA runtime) compiled against a particular version of the driver API will continue to work on subsequent device driver releases as illustrated in Figure 12 . The driver API is not forward compatible , which means that applications, plug-ins, and libraries (including the CUDA runtime) compiled against a particular version of the driver API will not work on previous versions of the device driver. It is important to note that there are limitations on the mixing and matching of versions that is supported: Since only one version of the CUDA Driver can be installed at a time on a system, the installed driver must be of the same or higher version than the maximum Driver API version against which any application, plug-ins, or libraries that must run on that system were built. All plug-ins and libraries used by an application must use the same version of the CUDA Runtime unless they statically link to the Runtime, in which case multiple versions of the runtime can coexist in the same process space. Note that if nvcc is used to link the application, the static version of the CUDA Runtime library will be used by default, and all CUDA Toolkit libraries are statically linked against the CUDA Runtime. All plug-ins and libraries used by an application must use the same version of any libraries that use the runtime (such as cuFFT, cuBLAS, \u2026) unless statically linking to those libraries.

The exchange occurs simultaneously for all active threads within the warp (and named in mask ), moving 4 or 8 bytes of data per thread depending on the type. Threads within a warp are referred to as lanes , and may have an index between 0 and warpSize-1 (inclusive). Four source-lane addressing modes are supported: __shfl_sync() Direct copy from indexed lane __shfl_up_sync() Copy from a lane with lower ID relative to caller __shfl_down_sync() Copy from a lane with higher ID relative to caller __shfl_xor_sync() Copy from a lane based on bitwise XOR of own lane ID Threads may only read data from another thread which is actively participating in the __shfl_sync() command. If the target thread is inactive , the retrieved value is undefined. All of the __shfl_sync() intrinsics take an optional width parameter which alters the behavior of the intrinsic. width must have a value which is a power of two in the range [1, warpSize] (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32). Results are undefined for other values. __shfl_sync() returns the value of var held by the thread whose ID is given by srcLane . If width is less than warpSize then each subsection of the warp behaves as a separate entity with a starting logical lane ID of 0. If srcLane is outside the range [0:width-1] , the value returned corresponds to the value of var held by the srcLane modulo width (i.e. within the same subsection). __shfl_up_sync() calculates a source lane ID by subtracting delta from the caller\u2019s lane ID. The value of var held by the resulting lane ID is returned: in effect, var is shifted up the warp by delta lanes. If width is less than warpSize then each subsection of the warp behaves as a separate entity with a starting logical lane ID of 0. The source lane index will not wrap around the value of width , so effectively the lower delta lanes will be unchanged. __shfl_down_sync() calculates a source lane ID by adding delta to the caller\u2019s lane ID. The value of var held by the resulting lane ID is returned: this has the effect of shifting var down the warp by delta lanes. If width is less than warpSize then each subsection of the warp behaves as a separate entity with a starting logical lane ID of 0. As for __shfl_up_sync() , the ID number of the source lane will not wrap around the value of width and so the upper delta lanes will remain unchanged. __shfl_xor_sync() calculates a source line ID by performing a bitwise XOR of the caller\u2019s lane ID with laneMask : the value of var held by the resulting lane ID is returned. If width is less than warpSize then each group of width consecutive threads are able to access elements from earlier groups of threads, however if they attempt to access elements from later groups of threads their own value of var will be returned. This mode implements a butterfly addressing pattern such as is used in tree reduction and broadcast. The new *_sync shfl intrinsics take in a mask indicating the threads participating in the call. A bit, representing the thread\u2019s lane id, must be set for each participating thread to ensure they are properly converged before the intrinsic is executed by the hardware. Each calling thread must have its own bit set in the mask and all non-exited threads named in mask must execute the same intrinsic with the same mask, or the result is undefined.

The warp vote functions allow the threads of a given warp to perform a reduction-and-broadcast operation. These functions take as input an integer predicate from each thread in the warp and compare those values with zero. The results of the comparisons are combined (reduced) across the active threads of the warp in one of the following ways, broadcasting a single return value to each participating thread: __all_sync(unsigned mask, predicate) : Evaluate predicate for all non-exited threads in mask and return non-zero if and only if predicate evaluates to non-zero for all of them. __any_sync(unsigned mask, predicate) : Evaluate predicate for all non-exited threads in mask and return non-zero if and only if predicate evaluates to non-zero for any of them. __ballot_sync(unsigned mask, predicate) : Evaluate predicate for all non-exited threads in mask and return an integer whose Nth bit is set if and only if predicate evaluates to non-zero for the Nth thread of the warp and the Nth thread is active. __activemask() : Returns a 32-bit integer mask of all currently active threads in the calling warp. The Nth bit is set if the Nth lane in the warp is active when __activemask() is called. Inactive threads are represented by 0 bits in the returned mask. Threads which have exited the program are always marked as inactive. Note that threads that are convergent at an __activemask() call are not guaranteed to be convergent at subsequent instructions unless those instructions are synchronizing warp-builtin functions. For __all_sync , __any_sync , and __ballot_sync , a mask must be passed that specifies the threads participating in the call. A bit, representing the thread\u2019s lane ID, must be set for each participating thread to ensure they are properly converged before the intrinsic is executed by the hardware.

If a program does not use every single kernel it has included, then some kernels will be loaded unneccesarily. This is very common, especially if you include any libraries. Most of the time, programs only use a small amount of kernels from libraries they include. Thanks to Lazy Loading, programs are able to only load kernels they are actually going to use, saving time on initialization. This reduces memory overhead, both on GPU memory and host memory. Lazy Loading is enabled by setting the CUDA_MODULE_LOADING environment variable to LAZY . Firstly, CUDA Runtime will no longer load all modules during program initialization, with the exception of modules containing managed variables. Each module will be loaded on first usage of a variable or a kernel from that module. This optimization is only relevant to CUDA Runtime users, CUDA Driver users who use cuModuleLoad are unaffected.

The behavior for CUDA Driver users who use cuLibraryLoad to load module data into memory can be changed by setting the CUDA_MODULE_DATA_LOADING environment variable.

The topology of the updating graph must be identical to the original graph used to instantiate the cudaGraphExec_t . In addition, the order in which the dependencies are specified must match. Finally, CUDA needs to consistently order the sink nodes (nodes with no dependencies). CUDA relies on the order of specific api calls to achieve consistent sink node ordering. More explicitly, following the following rules will cause cudaGraphExecUpdate() to pair the nodes in the original graph and the updating graph deterministically: For any capturing stream, the API calls operating on that stream must be made in the same order, including event wait and other api calls not directly corresponding to node creation. The API calls which directly manipulate a given graph node\u2019s incoming edges (including captured stream APIs, node add APIs, and edge addition / removal APIs) must be made in the same order. Moreover, when dependencies are specified in arrays to these APIs, the order in which the dependencies are specified inside those arrays must match. Sink nodes must be consistently ordered. Sink nodes are nodes without dependent nodes / outgoing edges in the final graph at the time of the cudaGraphExecUpdate() invocation. The following operations affect sink node ordering (if present) and must (as a combined set) be made in the same order: Node add APIs resulting in a sink node. Edge removal resulting in a node becoming a sink node. cudaStreamUpdateCaptureDependencies() , if it removes a sink node from a capturing stream\u2019s dependency set. cudaStreamEndCapture() . The following example shows how the API could be used to update an instantiated graph: cudaGraphExec_t graphExec = NULL; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { cudaGraph_t graph; cudaGraphExecUpdateResult updateResult; cudaGraphNode_t errorNode; // In this example we use stream capture to create the graph. // You can also use the Graph API to produce a graph. cudaStreamBeginCapture(stream, cudaStreamCaptureModeGlobal); // Call a user-defined, stream based workload, for example do_cuda_work(stream); cudaStreamEndCapture(stream, &amp;graph); // If we&#x27;ve already instantiated the graph, try to update it directly // and avoid the instantiation overhead if (graphExec != NULL) { // If the graph fails to update, errorNode will be set to the // node causing the failure and updateResult will be set to a // reason code. cudaGraphExecUpdate(graphExec, graph, &amp;errorNode, &amp;updateResult); } // Instantiate during the first iteration or whenever the update // fails for any reason if (graphExec == NULL || updateResult != cudaGraphExecUpdateSuccess) { // If a previous update failed, destroy the cudaGraphExec_t // before re-instantiating it if (graphExec != NULL) { cudaGraphExecDestroy(graphExec); } // Instantiate graphExec from graph. The error node and // error message parameters are unused here. cudaGraphInstantiate(&amp;graphExec, graph, NULL, NULL, 0); } cudaGraphDestroy(graph); cudaGraphLaunch(graphExec, stream); cudaStreamSynchronize(stream); } A typical workflow is to create the initial cudaGraph_t using either the stream capture or graph API. The cudaGraph_t is then instantiated and launched as normal. After the initial launch, a new cudaGraph_t is created using the same method as the initial graph and cudaGraphExecUpdate() is called. If the graph update is successful, indicated by the updateResult parameter in the above example, the updated cudaGraphExec_t is launched. If the update fails for any reason, the cudaGraphExecDestroy() and cudaGraphInstantiate() are called to destroy the original cudaGraphExec_t and instantiate a new one. It is also possible to update the cudaGraph_t nodes directly (i.e., Using cudaGraphKernelNodeSetParams() ) and subsequently update the cudaGraphExec_t , however it is more efficient to use the explicit node update APIs covered in the next section.

The mapping of matrix elements into fragment internal storage is unspecified and subject to change in future architectures. Only certain combinations of template arguments are allowed. The first template parameter specifies how the fragment will participate in the matrix operation. Acceptable values for Use are: matrix_a when the fragment is used as the first multiplicand, A , matrix_b when the fragment is used as the second multiplicand, B , or accumulator when the fragment is used as the source or destination accumulators ( C or D , respectively). The m , n and k sizes describe the shape of the warp-wide matrix tiles participating in the multiply-accumulate operation. The dimension of each tile depends on its role. For matrix_a the tile takes dimension m x k ; for matrix_b the dimension is k x n , and accumulator tiles are m x n . The data type, T , may be double , float , __half , __nv_bfloat16 , char , or unsigned char for multiplicands and double , float , int , or __half for accumulators. As documented in Element Types and Matrix Sizes , limited combinations of accumulator and multiplicand types are supported. The Layout parameter must be specified for matrix_a and matrix_b fragments. row_major or col_major indicate that elements within a matrix row or column are contiguous in memory, respectively. The Layout parameter for an accumulator matrix should retain the default value of void . A row or column layout is specified only when the accumulator is loaded or stored as described below. load_matrix_sync Waits until all warp lanes have arrived at load_matrix_sync and then loads the matrix fragment a from memory. mptr must be a 256-bit aligned pointer pointing to the first element of the matrix in memory. ldm describes the stride in elements between consecutive rows (for row major layout) or columns (for column major layout) and must be a multiple of 8 for __half element type or multiple of 4 for float element type. (i.e., multiple of 16 bytes in both cases). If the fragment is an accumulator , the layout argument must be specified as either mem_row_major or mem_col_major . For matrix_a and matrix_b fragments, the layout is inferred from the fragment\u2019s layout parameter. The values of mptr , ldm , layout and all template parameters for a must be the same for all threads in the warp.

(i.e., multiple of 16 bytes in both cases). The layout of the output matrix must be specified as either mem_row_major or mem_col_major . The values of mptr , ldm , layout and all template parameters for a must be the same for all threads in the warp. fill_fragment Fill a matrix fragment with a constant value v . Because the mapping of matrix elements to each fragment is unspecified, this function is ordinarily called by all threads in the warp with a common value for v . mma_sync Waits until all warp lanes have arrived at mma_sync, and then performs the warp-synchronous matrix multiply-accumulate operation D=A*B+C . The in-place operation, C=A*B+C , is also supported. The value of satf and template parameters for each matrix fragment must be the same for all threads in the warp. Also, the template parameters m , n and k must match between fragments A , B , C and D . This function must be called by all threads in the warp, or the result is undefined. If satf (saturate to finite value) mode is true , the following additional numerical properties apply for the destination accumulator: If an element result is +Infinity, the corresponding accumulator will contain +MAX_NORM If an element result is -Infinity, the corresponding accumulator will contain -MAX_NORM If an element result is NaN, the corresponding accumulator will contain +0 Because the map of matrix elements into each thread\u2019s fragment is unspecified, individual matrix elements must be accessed from memory (shared or global) after calling store_matrix_sync .

This is further complicated by threads holding only a fragment (opaque architecture-specific ABI data structure) of the overall matrix, with the developer not allowed to make assumptions on how the individual parameters are mapped to the registers participating in the matrix multiply-accumulate. Since fragments are architecture-specific, it is unsafe to pass them from function A to function B if the functions have been compiled for different link-compatible architectures and linked together into the same device executable. In this case, the size and layout of the fragment will be specific to one architecture and using WMMA APIs in the other will lead to incorrect results or potentially, corruption. An example of two link-compatible architectures, where the layout of the fragment differs, is sm_70 and sm_75. fragA.cu: void foo() { wmma::fragment&lt;...&gt; mat_a; bar(&amp;mat_a); } fragB.cu: void bar(wmma::fragment&lt;...&gt; *mat_a) { // operate on mat_a } // sm_70 fragment layout $&gt; nvcc -dc -arch=compute_70 -code=sm_70 fragA.cu -o fragA.o // sm_75 fragment layout $&gt; nvcc -dc -arch=compute_75 -code=sm_75 fragB.cu -o fragB.o // Linking the two together $&gt; nvcc -dlink -arch=sm_75 fragA.o fragB.o -o frag.o This undefined behavior might also be undetectable at compilation time and by tools at runtime, so extra care is needed to make sure the layout of the fragments is consistent. This linking hazard is most likely to appear when linking with a legacy library that is both built for a different link-compatible architecture and expecting to be passed a WMMA fragment. Note that in the case of weak linkages (for example, a CUDA C++ inline function), the linker may choose any available function definition which may result in implicit passes between compilation units. To avoid these sorts of problems, the matrix should always be stored out to memory for transit through external interfaces (e.g. wmma::store_matrix_sync(dst, \u2026); ) and then it can be safely passed to bar() as a pointer type [e.g. float *dst ].
