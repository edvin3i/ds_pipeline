Each cubin file targets a specific compute-capability version and is forward-compatible only with GPU architectures of the same major version number . For example, cubin files that target compute capability 3.0 are supported on all compute-capability 3.x (Kepler) devices but are not supported on compute-capability 5.x (Maxwell) devices. For this reason, to ensure forward compatibility with GPU architectures introduced after the application has been released, it is recommended that all applications include PTX versions of their kernels. CUDA Runtime applications containing both cubin and PTX code for a given architecture will automatically use the cubin by default, keeping the PTX path strictly for forward-compatibility purposes. Applications that already include PTX versions of their kernels should work as-is on Maxwell-based GPUs. Applications that only support specific GPU architectures via cubin files, however, will need to be updated to provide Maxwell-compatible PTX or cubins.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 3, "doc_id": 13, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#applications-using-cuda-toolkit-5-5-or-earlier", "display_name": "Applications Using CUDA Toolkit 5.5 or Earlier", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "applications-using-cuda-toolkit-5-5-or-earlier", "priority": -1, "content": "CUDA applications built using CUDA Toolkit versions 2.1 through 5.5 are compatible with Maxwell as long as they are built to include PTX versions of their kernels.

Set the environment variable CUDA_FORCE_PTX_JIT=1 . Launch your application. When starting a CUDA application for the first time with the above environment flag, the CUDA driver will JIT-compile the PTX for each CUDA kernel that is used into native cubin code.

If a cubin file supporting the architecture of the target GPU is available, it is used; otherwise, the CUDA Runtime will load the PTX and JIT-compile that PTX to the GPU\u2019s native cubin format before launching it. If neither is available, then the kernel launch will fail. The method used to build your application with either native cubin or at least PTX support for Maxwell depend on the version of the CUDA Toolkit used. The main advantages of providing native cubins are as follows: It saves the end user the time it takes to JIT-compile kernels that are available only as PTX. All kernels compiled into the application must have native binaries at load time or else they will be built just-in-time from PTX, including kernels from all libraries linked to the application, even if those kernels are never launched by the application. Especially when using large libraries, this JIT compilation can take a significant amount of time. The CUDA driver will cache the cubins generated as a result of the PTX JIT, so this is mostly a one-time cost for a given user, but it is time best avoided whenever possible. PTX JIT-compiled kernels often cannot take advantage of architectural features of newer GPUs, meaning that native-compiled code may be faster or of greater accuracy.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 6, "doc_id": 13, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#id2", "display_name": "Applications Using CUDA Toolkit 5.5 or Earlier", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "id2", "priority": -1, "content": "The compilers included in CUDA Toolkit 5.5 or earlier generate cubin files native to earlier NVIDIA architectures such as Fermi and Kepler, but they cannot generate cubin files native to the Maxwell architecture.
