Additionally, for writes from shared memory to global memory, it allows specifying element wise reduction operations such as add/min/max as well as bitwise and/or for most common data types. This has several advantages: Avoids using registers for moving data between the different memory spaces. Avoids using SM instructions for moving data: a single thread can issue large data movement instructions to the TMA unit. The whole block can then continue working on other instructions while the data is in flight and only wait for the data to be consumed when actually necessary. Enables users to write warp specialized codes, where specific warps specialize on data movement between the different memory spaces while other warps only work on local data within the SM.

A thread block can read from, write to, and perform atomics in shared memory of other thread blocks within its cluster. This is known as Distributed Shared Memory. As demonstrated in the CUDA C++ Programming Guide , there are applications that cannot fit required data within shared memory and must use global memory instead. Distributed shared memory can act as an intermediate step between these two options. Distributed Shared Memory can be used by an SM simultaneously with L2 cache accesses. This can benefit applications that need to communicate data between SMs by utilizing the combined bandwidth of both distributed shared memory and L2. In order to achieve best performance for accesses to Distributed Shared Memory, access patterns to those described in the CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide for Global Memory should be used. Specifically, accesses to Distributed Shared Memory should be coalesced and aligned to 32-byte segments, if possible. Access patterns with non-unit stride should be avoided if possible, which can be achieved by using local shared memory, similar to what is shown in the CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide for Shared Memory .

Hence, the H100 GPU enables a single thread block to address up to 227 KB of shared memory. To maintain architectural compatibility, static shared memory allocations remain limited to 48 KB, and an explicit opt-in is also required to enable dynamic allocations above this limit. See the CUDA C++ Programming Guide for details.
