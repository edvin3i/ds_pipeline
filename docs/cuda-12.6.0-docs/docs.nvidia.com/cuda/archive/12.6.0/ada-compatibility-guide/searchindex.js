Both cubin and PTX are generated for a certain target compute capability. A cubin generated for a certain compute capability is supported to run on any GPU with the same major revision and same or higher minor revision of compute capability. For example, a cubin generated for compute capability 8.6 is supported to run on a GPU with compute capability 8.9; however, a cubin generated for compute capability 8.9 is not supported to run on a GPU with compute capability 8.6, and a cubin generated with compute capability 8.x is not supported to run on a GPU with compute capability 9.0. Kernels can also be compiled to a PTX form. At the application load time, PTX is compiled to cubin and the cubin is used for kernel execution. Unlike cubin, PTX is forward-compatible. Meaning PTX is supported to run on any GPU with compute capability higher than the compute capability assumed for generation of that PTX. For example, PTX code generated for compute capability 8.x is supported to run on compute capability 8.x or any higher revision (major or minor), including compute capability 9.x. Therefore, although it is optional, it is recommended that all applications should include PTX of the kernels to ensure forward-compatibility. To read more about cubin and PTX compatibilities see Compilation with NVCC from the CUDA C++ Programming Guide . When a CUDA application launches a kernel on a GPU, the CUDA Runtime determines the compute capability of the GPU in the system and uses this information to find the best matching cubin or PTX version of the kernel. If a cubin compatible with that GPU is present in the binary, the cubin is used as-is for execution. Otherwise, the CUDA Runtime first generates compatible cubin by JIT-compiling 1 the PTX and then the cubin is used for the execution. If neither compatible cubin nor PTX is available, kernel launch results in a failure. Application binaries that include PTX version of kernels should work as-is on the NVIDIA Ada architecture based GPUs. In such cases, rebuilding the application is not required. However, application binaries that do not include PTX (only include cubins) need to be rebuilt to run on the NVIDIA Ada architecture based GPUs. To know more about building compatible applications, read Building Applications with the NVIDIA Ada GPU Architecture Support .", "keywords": []}, {"id": 3, "doc_id": 17, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "page", "name": "index#applications-built-using-cuda-toolkit-10-2-or-earlier", "display_name": "Applications Built Using CUDA Toolkit 10.2 or Earlier", "type": "section", "display_type": "Page section", "docname": "index", "anchor": "applications-built-using-cuda-toolkit-10-2-or-earlier", "priority": -1, "content": "CUDA applications built using CUDA Toolkit versions 2.1 through 10.2 are compatible with NVIDIA Ada architecture based GPUs as long as they are built to include PTX versions of their kernels.
