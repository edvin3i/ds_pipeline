The combined L1 cache capacity is 128 KB. In the NVIDIA Ada GPU architecture, the portion of the L1 cache dedicated to shared memory (known as the carveout ) can be selected at runtime as in previous architectures, such as NVIDIA Ampere, using cudaFuncSetAttribute() with the attribute cudaFuncAttributePreferredSharedMemoryCarveout . The NVIDIA Ada GPU architecture supports shared memory capacity of 0, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 100 KB per SM. CUDA reserves 1 KB of shared memory per thread block. Hence, GPUs with compute capability 8.9 can address up to 99 KB of shared memory in a single thread block. To maintain architectural compatibility, static shared memory allocations remain limited to 48 KB, and an explicit opt-in is also required to enable dynamic allocations above this limit. See the CUDA C++ Programming Guide for details. Like the NVIDIA Ampere and NVIDIA Volta GPU architectures, the NVIDIA Ada GPU architecture combines the functionality of the L1 and texture caches into a unified L1/Texture cache that acts as a coalescing buffer for memory accesses, gathering up the data requested by the threads of a warp prior to delivery of that data to the warp. Another benefit of its union with shared memory, similar to previous architectures, is improvement in terms of both latency and bandwidth.", "keywords": []}, {"id": 14, "doc_id": 14, "filename": "index.html", "domain_name": "std", "name": "index", "display_name": "NVIDIA Ada GPU Architecture Tuning Guide", "type": "doc", "display_type": "Page", "docname": "index", "anchor": "", "priority": -1, "content": "Tuning CUDA Applications for NVIDIA Ada GPU Architecture The programming guide for tuning CUDA Applications for GPUs based on the NVIDIA Ada GPU Architecture.", "keywords": []}]};
